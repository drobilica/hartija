Inspired by this economic market, Muse Games has taken ride sharing to the next logical step: emergency services.

You can battle these fires alone or you can team up with some friends and rescue people together.”</p>\n\n<p>Rescuing civilians isn’t always easy, and every call features its own pitfalls. Fortunately, overcoming Embr’s environmental hazards often leads to goofy hijinks thanks to Embr’s system-driven mechanics. Civilians follow you toward safety, but you will need to carve a path for them. Do you push back the flames with your water hose? Do you use your axe to open a new exit on a nearby wall? Or do you use a ladder to create a shortcut to the ground?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p><a target=\'_blank\' href=\'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/12/28/embr-preview-five-star-firefighting\'>Click here to watch embedded media</a><p></p>\n\n<p>Players choose how they overcome each obstacle and how they circumvent each challenge, but fire is like a wild creature and you don’t always know how it is going to act. When I took too long in one building, the fire ate through the floor and I fell into the basement, so I had to find another route outside. On another mission, I accidently knocked a civilian unconscious when I hit them with my water hose and I had to carry them to safety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“We discovered early on while designing puzzles with one solution that if someone doesn’t get it, the game falls apart, so from a design perspective we stopped designing puzzles and started designing obstacles,” Niederberger says. “It’s kind of a philosophical piece of our design ethos these days. We just put things in players’ ways and give them lots of tools. They might come up with a more interesting way to get through them than we would.”</p>\n\n<p>That toolset expands greatly as you use your firefighting earnings to purchase new equipment and vehicles directly from the Embr app. Most equipment can be upgraded several times. For example, water hoses have upgrades for greater water capacity and higher hose pressure, which makes it easier to push people and obstacles around. An auto refill upgrade means you won’t have to run back to your response vehicle in the middle of a mission. Another handy tool is the grappling hook, which can be used to pull people and other objects around the environment, and this can be upgraded to have a greater reach or to pull heavier objects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><i>Click image thumbnails to view larger version</i></p><a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/d43dab01/2.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/d43dab01/2.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/fee26938/3.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/fee26938/3.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/f67ccc3f/4.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/f67ccc3f/4.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/12caa6c6/5.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/12caa6c6/5.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/dc195bef/6.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/dc195bef/6.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/dc107305/7.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/dc107305/7.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/67880f09/9.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/67880f09/9.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/e802d58b/1.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/e802d58b/1.jpeg" /></a> <p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<p>Embr isn’t the only firefighting squad on the market, and during your rise to firefighting glory you might run into the competition. A Canadian firefighting startup called Hosr aims to bring socialized firefighting back to the United States. However, since you’ve signed a non-compete agreement with Embr, Hosr can’t hire you, which makes you their enemy.</p>\n\n<p>“Every once in a while, you’ll get a call that seems a little suspicious, and it won’t be your usual rescue mission,”&nbsp;Niederberger says. “When you get one of these suspicious calls, you might end up trapped in a building, and you’ll have to use your knowledge of firefighting to escape any way you can. These missions will be a little more puzzle oriented. There’ll be some mechanics that you have to learn a little more deeply, so you might need to spray water on an electrical outlet where the wires have been cut to open a door, for example.”</p>\n\n<p>Embr is goofy and full of oddball antics, but it also offers an interesting commentary on the perils of working as a contract laborer. Muse Games aims to unleash Embr early next year on PC, and is currently exploring console options. It might not set the world on fire, but we can’t wait to play more.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/67880f09/9.jpeg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>  \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> Gonzo Games/Sideline Amusements\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Muse Games\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2020\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> PC\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n  <p>We live in a gig economy, where the rise of social networking and mobile computing has allowed companies like Uber, Lyft, and AirBnb to alter the way we conduct business.

Another handy tool is the grappling hook, which can be used to pull people and other objects around the environment, and this can be upgraded to have a greater reach or to pull heavier objects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><i>Click image thumbnails to view larger version</i></p><a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/d43dab01/2.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/d43dab01/2.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/fee26938/3.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/fee26938/3.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/f67ccc3f/4.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/f67ccc3f/4.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/12caa6c6/5.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/12caa6c6/5.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/dc195bef/6.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/dc195bef/6.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/dc107305/7.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/dc107305/7.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/67880f09/9.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/67880f09/9.jpeg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/17/e802d58b/1.jpeg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/12/17/e802d58b/1.jpeg" /></a> <p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<p>Embr isn’t the only firefighting squad on the market, and during your rise to firefighting glory you might run into the competition. A Canadian firefighting startup called Hosr aims to bring socialized firefighting back to the United States. However, since you’ve signed a non-compete agreement with Embr, Hosr can’t hire you, which makes you their enemy.</p>\n\n<p>“Every once in a while, you’ll get a call that seems a little suspicious, and it won’t be your usual rescue mission,”&nbsp;Niederberger says. “When you get one of these suspicious calls, you might end up trapped in a building, and you’ll have to use your knowledge of firefighting to escape any way you can. These missions will be a little more puzzle oriented. There’ll be some mechanics that you have to learn a little more deeply, so you might need to spray water on an electrical outlet where the wires have been cut to open a door, for example.”</p>\n\n<p>Embr is goofy and full of oddball antics, but it also offers an interesting commentary on the perils of working as a contract laborer. Muse Games aims to unleash Embr early next year on PC, and is currently exploring console options. It might not set the world on fire, but we can’t wait to play more.</p>'}, 'published': 'Sat, 28 Dec 2019 11:00:00 CST', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=28, tm_hour=17, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=5, tm_yday=362, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Ben Reeves'}], 'author': 'Ben Reeves', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Ben Reeves'}, 'id': '109023', 'guidislink': False}{'title': "Hands On With Journey To The Savage Planet's Diabolical Third Biome", 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': "Hands On With Journey To The Savage Planet's Diabolical Third Biome"}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/12/16/hands-on-with-journey-to-the-savage-planets-diabolical-third-biome'}], 'link': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/12/16/hands-on-with-journey-to-the-savage-planets-diabolical-third-biome', 'summary': '<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> 505 Games\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Typhoon Studios\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">January 28, 2020</time>\n\t\t\t(<span class="gi5-details-platform">Xbox One</span>,\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class="gi5-details-platform">PC</span>), \t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">March 31, 2020</time>\n\t\t\t(<span class="gi5-details-platform">PlayStation 4</span>)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-rating">\n\t\t\t<b>Rating:</b> Rating Pending\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/12/16/44d99f03/jstp_screen_01.jpg" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I’ve courted death many times on this hostile planet, but my astronaut’s journey is ultimately cut short by a giant, angry frog.

The expansion, Return to Jurassic Park, is set to let players experiment with fixing the problems of the original dinosaur park from the hit \'90s films. I traveled to Frontier Developments to get my hands on the expansion and learn just how ambitious of a project this is.</p>\n\n<p>To this point, Jurassic World Evolution has seen several post-launch packs, including three premium DLC drops, seven dinosaur packs, and seven free updates. However, all of those additions took place within the modern Jurassic World.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/25/db4b5a42/jwe_screenshot_stegosaurus_97_01.jpg" alt="Jurassic World Evolution: Return To Jurassic Park" title="Jurassic World Evolution: Return To Jurassic Park" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>Return to Jurassic Park does just what its name says, giving players the keys to the iconic Jurassic Park gate in hopes that you can fix the problems from the first film and right the ship on the doomed theme park. In addition to introducing an all-new storyline comprised of seven narrative-based missions, Return to Jurassic Park brings back original cast members Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum to reprise the roles of Dr. Alan Grant, Dr. Ellie Sattler, and Dr. Ian Malcolm respectively.</p>\n\n<p>"[Recruiting the original actors] turned out to be relatively simple," game director Michael Brookes says.

However, after years of teases from Xbox, the Battletoads finally reemerged at E3 2019.</p>\n\n<p>For better and for worse, Battletoads plays a lot like the games that began the franchise. The three toads, Rash, Zitz, and Pimple, can and will jump right into any confrontation without a second’s thought.

However, with more than 13 years since the most recent entry, would-be pilots haven’t had the mainstay series to rely on. Thankfully, Microsoft Flight Simulator is back with a host of innovative features to give virtual pilots the most ambitious flight-simulation software ever created.</p>\n\n<p>As I sit into the cockpit of my virtual plane (a gaming chair in front of a desk with an advanced yoke system, complete with a throttle panel to my right and rudder panels at my feet), I’m loaded into a mid-flight instance over the gorgeous city of Naples, Italy. Suddenly appearing in the cockpit, I feel a brief sense of nervousness as I grip the control wheel. Looking around the iconic city, I’m stunned by how gorgeous everything looks. The distinct architecture of the seaside Italian city passes beneath my aircraft with photorealistic visuals. Though I’m responsible for keeping the small plane airborne, I can’t take my eyes off the city beneath me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/8f979465/xo_-c172_external.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>No matter where you choose to fly\xa0– and you can choose anywhere on the planet\xa0– the cities, landscapes, and natural landmarks are presented in photorealism. This is thanks to advanced photogrammetry that leverages data and textures from Microsoft’s Bing to create 3D models of every building, tree, and mountain on Earth. The team has to go in and make sure everything looks good (some trees and unique buildings like Seattle’s Space Needle don’t capture from satellite well), but the advanced machine learning used in this process greatly lowers the number of human hours put into creating this ultra-realistic planet. Then, it streams to your machine using Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology. Because of this, you can circumnavigate a photorealistic globe in a single session\xa0– if you have enough\xa0fuel.</p>\n\n<p>The team isn’t stopping there, however, as other real-time data helps deliver an even more authentic experience. As I continue flying over Naples, we change the weather mode in the environment. The initial load featured calm weather and clear skies. However, by adjusting one option, I’m suddenly experiencing the weather in Naples in real time; I guess it was a pretty windy morning in southern Italy. From there, I toggle to different cloud settings, various times of day, and even a low-visibility rainstorm where I must rely on my instruments. The team is also looking into real-time tracking of animal migrations, natural disasters, and even car traffic on the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/784b3c98/videorain-1.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>In addition, Microsoft Flight Simulator has the power to track real-world flight traffic using transponder signals. “We know where every airplane is, and we actually render it in real time,” says Microsoft’s Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator. “We [also] have A.I.-driven planes, and then everything from the air-traffic controller gets a slot. The interaction between us and the real world’s traffic is kind of complicated. You have options: You can either fly with just A.I. traffic and we control everything, or you fly with just real-world traffic. And then, the really hard one is the blend. We’re still working on that! It’s hard!”</p>\n\n<p>After enjoying the scenery of Naples for a while, I decide to try and land at Naples International Airport. After several botched approaches, I finally give myself a wide enough radius and begin descending toward the runway. As I get closer, I rely more on lowering my throttle and using the aircraft’s flaps to create drag than actually pointing the control wheel toward the ground. Keeping things steady as I get closer to the ground is difficult, as the slightest motion could cause me to roll too far to one side. After some gentle corrections on the way to the ground, I finally land. It’s a rough landing for sure, but I’m safe. Now that I’m on the ground, I press both feet into the rudders beneath the desk to bring the plane to a\xa0stop.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/68578453/ny-1.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>My next session takes me to the United States at Renton Municipal Airport near Microsoft’s offices just outside of Seattle. In this session, I’m already on the ground, but that’s not where I want to be. I pull up to the start of the runway and put the plane into full throttle. As I reach takeoff speed, I slowly pull back on the yoke and ascend to cruising altitude. Using my instruments, I easily reach the skies over Seattle. However, my most difficult challenge awaits.</p>\n\n<p>The final session takes me to Courchevel Altiport, one of the world’s most dangerous airports. Located in the French Alps, getting a perfect approach is important since you have little room for do-overs. In addition, the airport has a sloped runway, meaning you have to land at an incline rather than a flat surface. This means that you must pull the nose up at the last moment to land smoothly. While I lower the throttle too much on my first approach and crash into the nearby trees, for my second attempt I coast in towards a safe landing, only to veer slightly off course when I pull the nose up and land a bit rough. However, it was such a challenging scenario, I’ll take the rough landing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/0147dd0e/cockpitcap10-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>While I walked away from my time with Microsoft Flight Simulator impressed, you’ll need to make a serious investment into your hardware in order to enjoy it the way I did; the yoke system bundle I played on currently retails just over $300.

Though I’m responsible for keeping the small plane airborne, I can’t take my eyes off the city beneath me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/8f979465/xo_-c172_external.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>No matter where you choose to fly\xa0– and you can choose anywhere on the planet\xa0– the cities, landscapes, and natural landmarks are presented in photorealism. This is thanks to advanced photogrammetry that leverages data and textures from Microsoft’s Bing to create 3D models of every building, tree, and mountain on Earth. The team has to go in and make sure everything looks good (some trees and unique buildings like Seattle’s Space Needle don’t capture from satellite well), but the advanced machine learning used in this process greatly lowers the number of human hours put into creating this ultra-realistic planet. Then, it streams to your machine using Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology. Because of this, you can circumnavigate a photorealistic globe in a single session\xa0– if you have enough\xa0fuel.</p>\n\n<p>The team isn’t stopping there, however, as other real-time data helps deliver an even more authentic experience. As I continue flying over Naples, we change the weather mode in the environment. The initial load featured calm weather and clear skies. However, by adjusting one option, I’m suddenly experiencing the weather in Naples in real time; I guess it was a pretty windy morning in southern Italy. From there, I toggle to different cloud settings, various times of day, and even a low-visibility rainstorm where I must rely on my instruments. The team is also looking into real-time tracking of animal migrations, natural disasters, and even car traffic on the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/784b3c98/videorain-1.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>In addition, Microsoft Flight Simulator has the power to track real-world flight traffic using transponder signals. “We know where every airplane is, and we actually render it in real time,” says Microsoft’s Jorg Neumann, head of Microsoft Flight Simulator. “We [also] have A.I.-driven planes, and then everything from the air-traffic controller gets a slot. The interaction between us and the real world’s traffic is kind of complicated. You have options: You can either fly with just A.I. traffic and we control everything, or you fly with just real-world traffic. And then, the really hard one is the blend. We’re still working on that! It’s hard!”</p>\n\n<p>After enjoying the scenery of Naples for a while, I decide to try and land at Naples International Airport. After several botched approaches, I finally give myself a wide enough radius and begin descending toward the runway. As I get closer, I rely more on lowering my throttle and using the aircraft’s flaps to create drag than actually pointing the control wheel toward the ground. Keeping things steady as I get closer to the ground is difficult, as the slightest motion could cause me to roll too far to one side. After some gentle corrections on the way to the ground, I finally land. It’s a rough landing for sure, but I’m safe. Now that I’m on the ground, I press both feet into the rudders beneath the desk to bring the plane to a\xa0stop.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/68578453/ny-1.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>My next session takes me to the United States at Renton Municipal Airport near Microsoft’s offices just outside of Seattle. In this session, I’m already on the ground, but that’s not where I want to be. I pull up to the start of the runway and put the plane into full throttle. As I reach takeoff speed, I slowly pull back on the yoke and ascend to cruising altitude. Using my instruments, I easily reach the skies over Seattle. However, my most difficult challenge awaits.</p>\n\n<p>The final session takes me to Courchevel Altiport, one of the world’s most dangerous airports. Located in the French Alps, getting a perfect approach is important since you have little room for do-overs. In addition, the airport has a sloped runway, meaning you have to land at an incline rather than a flat surface. This means that you must pull the nose up at the last moment to land smoothly. While I lower the throttle too much on my first approach and crash into the nearby trees, for my second attempt I coast in towards a safe landing, only to veer slightly off course when I pull the nose up and land a bit rough. However, it was such a challenging scenario, I’ll take the rough landing.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/0147dd0e/cockpitcap10-2.jpg" alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" title="Microsoft Flight Simulator" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>While I walked away from my time with Microsoft Flight Simulator impressed, you’ll need to make a serious investment into your hardware in order to enjoy it the way I did; the yoke system bundle I played on currently retails just over $300. It’s all but certain that playing on a keyboard or controller would feel substantially less immersive, but those who are there for the thrill of exploring the planet from the point-of-view of birds can still do so without the fancy\xa0peripherals.</p>\n\n<p>With so much amazing technology at work, Microsoft Flight Simulator is infinitely ambitious, and if what I experienced with my hands-on time is any indication, aspiring pilots and newcomers should be excited to take to this sky in the series’ upcoming return.</p>'}, 'published': 'Fri, 22 Nov 2019 11:12:00 CST', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=22, tm_hour=17, tm_min=12, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=4, tm_yday=326, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Brian Shea'}], 'author': 'Brian Shea', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Brian Shea'}, 'id': '108898', 'guidislink': False}{'title': 'CrossfireX Preview – Making A Push For Global Domination', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': 'CrossfireX Preview – Making A Push For Global Domination'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/11/21/crossfirex-preview-making-a-push-for-global-domination'}], 'link': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/11/21/crossfirex-preview-making-a-push-for-global-domination', 'summary': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/21/93c161e0/crossfirex_thumbnails_nologo_bf01.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="CrossFireX" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>   \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> Xbox Game Studios\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Smilegate, Remedy Entertainment\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2020\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> Xbox One\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n <p>CrossFire first took Korea by storm in 2007, becoming one of the most-played and top-grossing video games ever.

With a strong pedigree, an overwhelmingly successful past, and an updated suite of features and gameplay, CrossfireX could prove to be a big hit when it comes to Xbox One next year.</p>'}, 'published': 'Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:44:00 CST', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=21, tm_hour=21, tm_min=44, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=325, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Brian Shea'}], 'author': 'Brian Shea', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Brian Shea'}, 'id': '108896', 'guidislink': False}{'title': '10 Exciting Details About Obsidian’s Grounded', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': '10 Exciting Details About Obsidian’s Grounded'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/11/14/10-exciting-details-about-obsidians-grounded'}], 'link': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/11/14/10-exciting-details-about-obsidians-grounded', 'summary': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/11/14/bbfc43be/friends.jpeg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>  \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> Microsoft Game Studios\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Obsidian Entertainment\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2020\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> Xbox One, PC\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n  <p>Obsidian Entertainment is best known for its work on RPGs like Pillars of Eternity, Fallout: New Vegas, and The Outer Worlds, but the team has recently been hard at work on something entirely new: a survival game where you are the size of a bug.

The 10-episode project earned broad acclaim upon its release a few months ago, thanks to its rich fantasy storytelling communicated through technical and artistic mastery. The series gains a companion project, in the form of a tactics game that helps to fill in some of the gaps in the show.

However, instead of it being the typical professor giving the monologue, Sword and Shield open with a speech from Chairman Rose in the middle of stadium in the style of a TV broadcast. The speech goes over the same beats as your typical Pokémon opening, but sets the tone for the sports-centric atmosphere in the Galar region. After a brief speech, undefeated Galar champion Leon emerges to begin a battle with a character I can’t yet discuss. Leon calls out his trusty Charizard and the broadcast cuts away just as his Charizard grows enormous in size.</p>\n\n<p>Once you assume control of your character, you’re inside your idyllic countryside home. Your mum (get ready for lots of U.K.-inspired slang, by the way) and your friend Hop encourage you out the door as you learn the basics of the game.

Catching Pokémon gives you experience, and each encounter splits the XP between your entire team automatically.

While the idea is initially met with hesitance – after all, you literally just got your starter Pokémon like 25 minutes ago – a battle with Hop changes their minds and you receive a Letter of Endorsement so you can challenge the gym leaders throughout Galar, starting with the nearest major city: Motostoke.</p>\n\n<p>Once I receive the Letter of Endorsement, a shiny object falls from the sky. This Wishing Star grants me access to the Dynamax ability, which causes your Pokémon to grow massive and powerful in battle. Now it’s on to Motostoke, the first big city in my journey (you can see part of the city in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-video/2019/10/15/visiting-game-freak-for-pokemon-sword-and-shield">our exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Game Freak</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/956dc180/screenshot_03.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>On my way, I find a TM for Swift. TMs in Sword and Shield are multi-use, so I don’t have to worry about painstakingly deciding which creature to use it on. Before I can make it to Motostoke, I must venture through the Wild Area.</p>\n\n<p>The Wild Area feels large from the very beginning. In this part of Galar, the camera swings behind my character and I can rotate it 360 degrees. As I run through the area, different biomes present themselves with unique Pokémon running and flying around. I don’t have time to venture into the tall grass to see which Pokémon are hidden in there, but I notice the weather changes between the different parts of the Wild Area, dictating to an extent which Pokémon appear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/4f60f65f/screenshot_13.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I finally arrive in Motostoke, a relatively giant town that puts Wedgehurst to shame. I have just enough time to tour around the streets, get a glimpse into the clothing boutique, and see the outside of the gym before my time with the game ends. After spending an hour and a half in Galar, I’m even more excited to see what lies beyond Motostoke and the Wild Area. Thankfully, we don’t have long to wait, as Pokémon Sword and Shield launch November 15.</p>\n\n<p>For more on Pokémon Sword and Shield, be sure to check out our exclusive coverage hub by clicking the banner below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity"><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/pokemon">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/2019/09/26/715e55ea/319pokehubcoverage.jpg" typeof="Image" />\n      \n  \n\n\n</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/16ced1fa/screenshot_15.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>  \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> The Pokemon Company, Nintendo\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Game Freak\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">November 15, 2019</time>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-rating">\n\t\t\t<b>Rating:</b> Everyone\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> Switch\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield have looked impressive every step of the way, but while we were able to play through a gym at E3 this year, extended hands-on time has eluded us thus far.

However, instead of it being the typical professor giving the monologue, Sword and Shield open with a speech from Chairman Rose in the middle of stadium in the style of a TV broadcast. The speech goes over the same beats as your typical Pokémon opening, but sets the tone for the sports-centric atmosphere in the Galar region.

With a subtle emphasis on Leon bringing the grass-type back to his possession, I ask if we’ll ever see that particular Grookey again. The team declines to comment. As is tradition, with our first Pokémon in our possession, I battle my rival.</p>\n\n<p>The transition from the overworld to battle is flashy, with expressive trainer images leading directly into their Pokémon sequence. It feels cinematic, even though it’s not anything we haven’t seen in other games outside of Pokémon before. After winning the battle, it’s time to head back to Wedgehurst – this time to visit Professor Magnolia’s lab. However, upon leaving, a Wooloo has broken through the fence by your house, so you must wander into the eerie Slumbering Weald to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/ebebc22b/screenshot_17.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>In the foggy Slumbering Weald, I run into a couple different types of new Pokémon, which I unfortunately can’t talk about. As I venture deeper into the woods, a mysterious creature appears before me. While I can’t spoil what happens, I eventually exit the Slumbering Weald, Wooloo by my side, and am back on track toward Wedgehurst.</p>\n\n<p>After arriving at Professor Magnolia’s lab, it quickly becomes apparent that she’s not there. Instead, Sonia, Magnolia’s granddaughter and assistant, greets me. Unfortunately, Professor Magnolia is on a trip north of Wedgehurst, so I’m off once again. However, before venturing out of the town, I swing by the Pokémon Center. Galarian Pokémon Centers continue down the path of being one-stop shops for many of your Pokémon needs. In addition to healing your Pokémon through the nurse, you can also have their nicknames rated, rename them, or even delete moves. You can also access the PC and buy supplies in the shop. After stocking up, it’s time to venture to Professor Magnolia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/044b83c8/screenshot_12.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>On the way to Magnolia’s location, I encounter seven different Pokémon in the wild. While I can’t say any of the creatures aside from Yamper, I love how different Pokémon appear in the tall grass through random encounters than do as creatures that roam in the environment. This not only gives you a sense of a living world, but also the mystique of being surprised when an encounter starts without you having initiated it. Catching Pokémon gives you experience, and each encounter splits the XP between your entire team automatically. You can also whistle to attract wild Pokémon to your position.</p>\n\n<p>By the time I reach the end of the route, I have a full team of Pokémon that have reached just below or just above level 10.

As is tradition, with our first Pokémon in our possession, I battle my rival.</p>\n\n<p>The transition from the overworld to battle is flashy, with expressive trainer images leading directly into their Pokémon sequence. It feels cinematic, even though it’s not anything we haven’t seen in other games outside of Pokémon before. After winning the battle, it’s time to head back to Wedgehurst – this time to visit Professor Magnolia’s lab. However, upon leaving, a Wooloo has broken through the fence by your house, so you must wander into the eerie Slumbering Weald to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/ebebc22b/screenshot_17.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>In the foggy Slumbering Weald, I run into a couple different types of new Pokémon, which I unfortunately can’t talk about. As I venture deeper into the woods, a mysterious creature appears before me. While I can’t spoil what happens, I eventually exit the Slumbering Weald, Wooloo by my side, and am back on track toward Wedgehurst.</p>\n\n<p>After arriving at Professor Magnolia’s lab, it quickly becomes apparent that she’s not there. Instead, Sonia, Magnolia’s granddaughter and assistant, greets me. Unfortunately, Professor Magnolia is on a trip north of Wedgehurst, so I’m off once again. However, before venturing out of the town, I swing by the Pokémon Center. Galarian Pokémon Centers continue down the path of being one-stop shops for many of your Pokémon needs. In addition to healing your Pokémon through the nurse, you can also have their nicknames rated, rename them, or even delete moves. You can also access the PC and buy supplies in the shop. After stocking up, it’s time to venture to Professor Magnolia.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/044b83c8/screenshot_12.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>On the way to Magnolia’s location, I encounter seven different Pokémon in the wild. While I can’t say any of the creatures aside from Yamper, I love how different Pokémon appear in the tall grass through random encounters than do as creatures that roam in the environment. This not only gives you a sense of a living world, but also the mystique of being surprised when an encounter starts without you having initiated it. Catching Pokémon gives you experience, and each encounter splits the XP between your entire team automatically. You can also whistle to attract wild Pokémon to your position.</p>\n\n<p>By the time I reach the end of the route, I have a full team of Pokémon that have reached just below or just above level 10. Unfortunately, my time is short, so I don’t have enough time to continue to grind and see the first evolution of Sobble. The water starter reaches level 12 before I admit defeat in this endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/ce765906/screenshot_05.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>After meeting up with Professor Magnolia and Leon to learn about the Dynamax phenomenon she’s studying, you and Hop ask for letters of endorsements so you can compete against gym leaders to earn the right to battle in the Pokémon League. While the idea is initially met with hesitance – after all, you literally just got your starter Pokémon like 25 minutes ago – a battle with Hop changes their minds and you receive a Letter of Endorsement so you can challenge the gym leaders throughout Galar, starting with the nearest major city: Motostoke.</p>\n\n<p>Once I receive the Letter of Endorsement, a shiny object falls from the sky. This Wishing Star grants me access to the Dynamax ability, which causes your Pokémon to grow massive and powerful in battle. Now it’s on to Motostoke, the first big city in my journey (you can see part of the city in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive-video/2019/10/15/visiting-game-freak-for-pokemon-sword-and-shield">our exclusive behind-the-scenes look at Game Freak</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/956dc180/screenshot_03.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>On my way, I find a TM for Swift. TMs in Sword and Shield are multi-use, so I don’t have to worry about painstakingly deciding which creature to use it on. Before I can make it to Motostoke, I must venture through the Wild Area.</p>\n\n<p>The Wild Area feels large from the very beginning. In this part of Galar, the camera swings behind my character and I can rotate it 360 degrees. As I run through the area, different biomes present themselves with unique Pokémon running and flying around. I don’t have time to venture into the tall grass to see which Pokémon are hidden in there, but I notice the weather changes between the different parts of the Wild Area, dictating to an extent which Pokémon appear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/16/4f60f65f/screenshot_13.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I finally arrive in Motostoke, a relatively giant town that puts Wedgehurst to shame. I have just enough time to tour around the streets, get a glimpse into the clothing boutique, and see the outside of the gym before my time with the game ends. After spending an hour and a half in Galar, I’m even more excited to see what lies beyond Motostoke and the Wild Area. Thankfully, we don’t have long to wait, as Pokémon Sword and Shield launch November 15.</p>\n\n<p>For more on Pokémon Sword and Shield, be sure to check out our exclusive coverage hub by clicking the banner below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity"><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/pokemon">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/2019/09/26/715e55ea/319pokehubcoverage.jpg" typeof="Image" />\n      \n  \n\n\n</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article>'}, 'published': 'Thu, 17 Oct 2019 08:00:00 CDT', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=13, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=290, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Brian Shea'}], 'author': 'Brian Shea', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Brian Shea'}, 'id': '108750', 'guidislink': False}{'title': "How MediEvil Remake Captures The Original's Intended Vision", 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': "How MediEvil Remake Captures The Original's Intended Vision"}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/10/15/how-medievil-remake-captures-the-originals-intended-vision'}], 'link': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2019/10/15/how-medievil-remake-captures-the-originals-intended-vision', 'summary': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/10/15/89f5cbbb/medievil_short-lived_demo_20191014121428.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>  \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> Sony Computer Entertainment\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Other Ocean Interactive\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">October 25, 2019</time>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-rating">\n\t\t\t<b>Rating:</b> Teen\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> PlayStation 4\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n  <p>It’s been twenty-one years since the original MediEvil spooked players.

"This time around, we really wanted to introduce some systems that help the player be able to take those Pokémon they caught in the beginning, and the first one they chose, and actually take them straight into competitive battle. There’s a lot of hidden parameters to Pokémon that aren’t surfaced to the player.

"I’ve got to be very vague about it, but one example – it will be visible to the player and they’ll know when they see it, I think – say you have a Pokémon where it’s got all the right stats and everything, but there’s a personality parameter as well that comes into play in battles, and it might not be the right personality, so you’ll breed until you get the right one, is what people do currently. But you’ll see that there’s a system in the game that will fix that for people."</p>\n\n<p>While it\'s no longer necessary to do so, Iwao says players can still put effort into breeding to come up with the perfect specimen for competitive play. "We do think there’s value in that effort that players put into it," he says. "But at the same time, I think with Sword and Shield we wanted to also have a system that makes it a little bit more accessible. For example, if you’re bringing a Pokémon over from a previous game into these games, being able to use that specific Pokémon that has sentimental value to you in the battle system competitively is something we wanted to try this time."</p>\n\n<p>For more on Pokémon Sword and Shield, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity"><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/pokemon">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/2019/09/26/715e55ea/319pokehubcoverage.jpg" typeof="Image" />\n      \n  \n\n\n</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/17/e08004fc/switch_pokemonswordpokemonshield_screen_117.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>   \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> The Pokemon Company, Nintendo\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Game Freak\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">November 15, 2019</time>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-rating">\n\t\t\t<b>Rating:</b> Everyone\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> Switch\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n <p>The latest entries in the Pokémon series are making several tweaks to the franchise\'s long-running conventions.

One of the smaller, yet interesting pieces of info we learned involves Exp.

These special moves, which could be taught to multiple Pokémon, then used in battle and in special circumstances outside of battle, were replaced in Sun and Moon with Ride Pokémon. During our trip to Game Freak\'s Tokyo headquarters for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2019/10/01/november-cover-revealed-pokemon-sword-and-shield">this month\'s cover story</a>, we asked about the role of HMs in Pokémon Sword and Shield.</p>\n\n<p>According to planning director Kazumasa Iwao, HMs didn\'t fit into the philosophy of Pokémon Sword and Shield. "I think they played a role in the series traditionally to be like the relationship between a door and a key; the HM will unlock something and you’re able to progress and feel the ability to go to a new place," he says.

During E3, producer Junichi Masuda explained that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2019/2019/06/17/not-all-pokemon-will-transfer-to-sword-and-shield">not every Pokémon will make the leap into Sword and Shield</a>. This news left many fans disappointed, so I caught up with Masuda during our trip for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2019/10/01/november-cover-revealed-pokemon-sword-and-shield">this month\'s cover story</a> to dive deeper into the reasoning for the cuts.</p>\n\n<p>According to Masuda, the sheer number of Pokémon the series had accumulated over the last two-plus decades got to the point of being unwieldy. "Up until now, we’ve been proud we’ve been able to include so many Pokémon in the games, but as a result of that, there’s actually been quite a few features or gameplay ideas that we’ve had to abandon in the past," he says. "Going forward, thinking about the future of Pokémon, we want to prioritize all those new gameplay ideas, new ways to enjoy the game, and want to challenge ourselves at Game Freak to create new ways to enjoy the game. That’s really what drove the decision for this new direction."</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/17/e339e0e0/switch_pokemonswordpokemonshield_screen_87.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>The decision was the result of collaborative talks between Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo. "We have a lot of awesome new challenges that we haven’t even revealed in Sword and Shield," Masuda says. "We want to continue to come up with these new features, so we figured this was the best path forward for the franchise"</p>\n\n<p>Things are a bit complicated when diving into how the team decided which Pokémon wouldn\'t carry over into the Galar region. "A wide variety of discussions happened; it’s not just one kind of criteria for deciding which Pokémon are going to appear in the games, but a lot of different reasons, a lot of different directions, a lot of debate over which ones would be the best in the game," Masuda says. "I think one example of that is figuring out the Pokémon that would make sense for the setting of the game the most; these Pokémon look like they could live in the Galar region.

That’s really what drove the decision for this new direction."</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/17/e339e0e0/switch_pokemonswordpokemonshield_screen_87.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>The decision was the result of collaborative talks between Game Freak, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo. "We have a lot of awesome new challenges that we haven’t even revealed in Sword and Shield," Masuda says. "We want to continue to come up with these new features, so we figured this was the best path forward for the franchise"</p>\n\n<p>Things are a bit complicated when diving into how the team decided which Pokémon wouldn\'t carry over into the Galar region. "A wide variety of discussions happened; it’s not just one kind of criteria for deciding which Pokémon are going to appear in the games, but a lot of different reasons, a lot of different directions, a lot of debate over which ones would be the best in the game," Masuda says. "I think one example of that is figuring out the Pokémon that would make sense for the setting of the game the most; these Pokémon look like they could live in the Galar region. We really spent a lot of effort deciding which would best fit the setting of the adventure and the features that we wanted to implement. I think players will be satisfied. There’s quite a few Pokémon that you’ll encounter in the Galar region Pokédex, so I think players will have fun seeing all the Pokémon."</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/17/a690e0a4/switch_pokemonswordpokemonshield_screen_05.png" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>When I ask for specifics about the Pokémon that didn\'t make the cut for Sword and Shield – including names and total number of creatures – Masuda did not elaborate. However, he was much more explicit when I asked if cut Pokémon will return in future games. "Definitely," he says. "You can look forward to seeing Pokémon that don’t appear in these games appearing in different regions in future games. I think Pokémon Home, for a lot of players, will serve as a launching pad to gather them all there and then embark on future adventures."</p>\n\n<p>Pokémon Home <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/05/28/pokemon-home-brings-all-your-pokemon-under-one-online-roof">has been announced</a>, but details to this point are scarce. Masuda intends on keeping it that way for a bit longer, but he did offer a bit more insight into the upcoming app. "We’re really designing it as the place for all of your Pokémon together, so it’s really important for the future of the franchise, and it’ll be more than even Pokémon Bank as a place to gather all your Pokémon together in one spot."</p>\n\n<p>We\'ll have to see which Pokémon we encounter in the Galar region when Pokémon Sword and Shield launch November 15.</p>\n\n<p>For more on Pokémon Sword and Shield, head to our hub by clicking the banner below.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity"><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/pokemon">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/2019/09/26/715e55ea/319pokehubcoverage.jpg" typeof="Image" />\n      \n  \n\n\n</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article>'}, 'published': 'Tue, 01 Oct 2019 11:45:00 CDT', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=10, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=16, tm_min=45, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=274, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Brian Shea'}], 'author': 'Brian Shea', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Brian Shea'}, 'id': '108616', 'guidislink': False}{'title': 'Pokémon Sword And Shield Introduce Autosave To The Series', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': 'Pokémon Sword And Shield Introduce Autosave To The Series'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/10/01/pokemon-sword-and-shield-introduce-autosave-to-the-series'}], 'link': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/10/01/pokemon-sword-and-shield-introduce-autosave-to-the-series', 'summary': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/30/a1e822c4/wild_area.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>   \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> The Pokemon Company, Nintendo\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Game Freak\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">November 15, 2019</time>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-rating">\n\t\t\t<b>Rating:</b> Everyone\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> Switch\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n <p>During our trip to Game Freak\'s Tokyo headquarters for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2019/10/01/november-cover-revealed-pokemon-sword-and-shield">this month\'s cover story</a>, we learned all kinds of behind-the-scenes information about Pokémon Sword and Shield.

While talking with the developers about the new features coming to Sword and Shield, director Shigeru Ohmori mentioned autosave occurring in the Wild Area.</p>\n\n<p>Normally after you perform a trade, you\'d need to stop and save, but instead, Game Freak figured out a way to incorporate seamless saves into the Wild Area. "When you connect with them to actually trade or do some kind of interaction, it then seamlessly switches to a synchronous connection," Ohmori says. "It’s also saving in the background, which is something we previously didn’t do, so there’s quite a bit going on in there that is represented in the Wild Area."</p>\n\n<p>At the mention of "saving in the background," I asked Ohmori if that happens throughout the rest of the game, or if that\'s restricted to the Wild Area. "It’s a new feature we’re implementing: full autosave functionality," he says. "Traditionally in Pokémon games, it’s an important thing to write your report to record your save, and that’s always been a staple, like, "Remember to save your game!" We do have an autosave feature this time, where you can just adventure and it’ll constantly save the game."</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/17/974fdc53/switch_pokemonswordpokemonshield_screen_41.jpg" alt="Pokémon Sword and Shield" title="Pokémon Sword and Shield" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>For those who don\'t want Pokémon Sword and Shield to autosave, fear not: You can turn the feature off and stick with the traditional save method where you pause the action and manually save. I imagine that will come in handy for encounters with difficult-to-catch Legendary Pokémon. However, Ohmori says that process might also feel a bit different on Switch.</p>\n\n<p>"I think the Nintendo Switch, compared to previous consoles, it’s actually a bit harder to restart your game," he says.

More specifically, it\'s the T-800 model, as portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The reveal was accompanied by a gameplay trailer, which highlights a nice slice of his moveset. He\'s able to blast enemies with his shotgun (complete with the fancy reload animation from <em>Terminator 2</em>), headbutt them with his metal noggin, and basically rule the arena like the unstoppable killing machine that he is. There are some other great moments in the clip, like showing off what happens when he gets hit with fire (thanks a lot, Scorpion!) and his fatality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The T-800 is hitting Mortal Kombat 11 on October 15, or October 8 if you have the&nbsp;Kombat Pack.

More specifically, it\'s the T-800 model, as portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The reveal was accompanied by a gameplay trailer, which highlights a nice slice of his moveset. He\'s able to blast enemies with his shotgun (complete with the fancy reload animation from <em>Terminator 2</em>), headbutt them with his metal noggin, and basically rule the arena like the unstoppable killing machine that he is. There are some other great moments in the clip, like showing off what happens when he gets hit with fire (thanks a lot, Scorpion!) and his fatality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The T-800 is hitting Mortal Kombat 11 on October 15, or October 8 if you have the&nbsp;Kombat Pack. Those are the same days owners of the pass will be able to get the Harley Quinn-inspired skin for Cassie Cage, as well as Kano\'s "Cash Machine Kano" skin and Johnny Cage\'s "Red Carpet Johnny Cage."

date. Recently, we got a small (two hour) taste of this ambitious project, but we walked away incredibly satisfied. It almost goes without saying that The Last of Us fans should be excited for the game’s launch on February 21, but here are four other big takeaways from our time with the game.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Prepare to feel rage</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The original Last of Us explored a child/parent relationship between Joel and Ellie. Naughty Dog says that if the first game was about exploring that kind of love, then the sequel explores a completely different kind of emotion: rage.</p>\n\n<p>Ellie grew up in a broken world – a planet where a fungal outbreak transformed most of humanity into zombie-like monsters. However, by the end of the first game, Ellie reaches a safe haven where it seems that she might have the chance to build a new life and experience some of the joys that many of us take for granted. As Part II opens, Ellie lives inside a relatively safe community of people and she even has the chance to explore a romantic relationship with another young girl named Dina.</p>\n\n<p>However, at some point in the game, Ellie faces a tragedy that completely changes her outlook. Naughty Dog remains tight-lipped about the nature of this tragedy, but the event sets Ellie off on a quest for revenge. In The Last of Us Part II, we’ll get to see how Ellie behaves after she’s had the safety of a “normal” life ripped from her – we’ll get to see the lengths with which Ellie will go to punish those who have hurt her. You can see the pain etched into the lines in Ellie’s face every time she sneaks up behind an enemy and slides her knife into their throat. The Last of Us Part II isn’t a game for the squeamish.</p>\n\n<h2>Movement is key to survival</h2>\n\n<p>Like the first The Last of Us, Naughty Dog’s action feels grounded and brutal. Enemies coordinate their attacks and even call to each other by name. Ellie’s luck can quickly run out of she is surrounded and outnumbered. One of the best strategies remains to stay hidden for as long as possible and pick off your foes one-by-one. Fortunately, environments are large enough that I found it easy to run and find a hiding spot to catch my breath. Still, enemies won’t forget that they saw you and are constantly on your heels, which adds a lot of tension to the action. I felt like I was constantly on the move – taking a few sections to loot a room or craft an item before I had to hide again from a roaming patrol.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Joel, Ellie now has a jump button, so she can scamper and climb all over the environment. Climbing over things is sometimes a great way to avoid your captures, but it can also make you easier to spot.&nbsp;I found that it was often better to go low. Ellie can both crouch or go prone. Laying down in tall grass makes Ellie harder to spot, but as enemies get closer they will be more likely to see you. In The Last of Us Part II, you’re never completely hidden or safe.</p>\n\n<p><i>Click image thumbnails to view larger version</i></p><a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/c3db111c/tloupii_demo_screen_04.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/c3db111c/tloupii_demo_screen_04.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/dd972d47/tloupii_demo_screen_03.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/dd972d47/tloupii_demo_screen_03.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/e6c0973b/tloupii_demo_screen_02.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/e6c0973b/tloupii_demo_screen_02.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/b02834ef/tloupii_demo_screen_01.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/b02834ef/tloupii_demo_screen_01.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/a575f47e/tloupii_demo_screen_12.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/a575f47e/tloupii_demo_screen_12.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/f2852fd5/tloupii_demo_screen_11.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/f2852fd5/tloupii_demo_screen_11.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/dda011bd/tloupii_demo_screen_10.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/dda011bd/tloupii_demo_screen_10.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/ca57671e/tloupii_demo_screen_08.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/ca57671e/tloupii_demo_screen_08.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/65bfcc30/tloupii_demo_screen_07.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/65bfcc30/tloupii_demo_screen_07.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/a5573a7a/tloupii_demo_screen_06.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/a5573a7a/tloupii_demo_screen_06.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/e7604365/tloupii_demo_screen_05.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/e7604365/tloupii_demo_screen_05.jpg" /></a> <p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<h2>New enemies help heat up the action</h2>\n\n<p>The Last of Us Part II’s enemies are smarter than ever. Not only will human foes coordinate their attacks, they have a few new tools to use while hunting you. One of those tools is actually man’s best friend. Humans now employ hunting dogs, and they will use them to sniff you out. Using Ellie’s hunter’s vision, you can see your own scent trail and watch these animals slowly follow that trail to your current position. Dogs are a challenge to stealth kill because they can sense you coming, so you need to take them down from a distance with a bow and arrow or some other silent weapon. Unfortunately, you will feel like a monster every time you kill a dog. At one point, a sniped a dog’s master, and the pup started to whine and paw at his master’s feet. I didn’t have the heart to kill the dog, which may have been a mistake, because the animal eventually caught my scent and hounded me until its teeth were in my throat.</p>\n\n<p>Another new enemy is a version of infected called the Shambler. These lumbering brutes aren’t too fast, but they are tanks who can’t be stealth killed and will force you to burn through a lot of ammo. At one point, I smashed the glass of a vending machine to get at the goodies inside and I inadvertently alerted a Shambler who was next door. The beast charged into my room and startled me. I tried hacking at the monster with a hatchet, but the creature released a toxic plume of gas that sent Ellie coughing her way to an early grave. Shamblers are dangerous creatures, and you should feel no shame in avoiding a fight with these horror shows. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Crafting is still king</h2>\n\n<p>Crafting was an important element of the first game, and it remains a huge focus in the sequel. As you explore these dilapidated cities, you can scavenge old homes and commercial districts for ingredients to make new weapons and other supplies. As in the first game, the same ingredients can be used to make a health pack or a molotov cocktail, forcing players to make a strategic choice: do you heal up or give yourself another offensive tool to help clear out the next room? This strategic pattern is repeated multiple times in the crafting menu for The Last of Us Part II. You won’t always be able to make everything you want, but you’ll have plenty of opportunities to make something good.</p>\n\n<p>One of the new gadgets I crafted is a trap bomb that can be strategically placed throughout the environment and triggers automatically like a landmine. I used these bombs occasionally to cover my tracks and they became a handy early warning system, alerting me whenever I was being followed.</p>\n\n<p>Some crafting items will be locked behind the upgrade menu. As with the first game, Ellie finds pills throughout the environment, which she can use to upgrade her skills. I used some pills to allow Ellie to crawl faster and gain a larger boost from health packs, but you probably won’t find enough pills to upgrade Ellie completely. In fact, at one point, I found a hunting magazine that unlocked an entirely new upgrade branch filled with things like reduced weapon sway and faster movement speed while aiming. So, it’s possible that some players won’t even unlock or discover certain upgrades during their playthrough.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p>For more about The Last of Us Part II, be sure to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/09/24/new-look-at-last-of-us-part-ii-reveals-frosty-clickers-story-teases-release-date">watch the most recent trailer</a> or catch up on the first game by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_last_of_us/b/ps3/archive/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review-naughty-dogs-grim-masterpiece.aspx">reading our review</a>.</p>', 'summary_detail': {'type': 'text/html', 'language': 'en', 'base': 'https://www.gameinformer.com/', 'value': '<p>  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/dd972d47/tloupii_demo_screen_03.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n\n\n</p>  \n<div class="game-details">\n\t\t\t<div class="game-details-publisher">\n\t\t\t<b>Publisher:</b> Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-developer">\n\t\t\t<b>Developer:</b> Naughty Dog\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-release">\n\t\t\t\t<b>Release:</b>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<time datetime="00Z" class="datetime">May 29, 2020</time>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class="game-details-rating">\n\t\t\t<b>Rating:</b> Rating Pending\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t<div class="game-details-platform">\n\t\t\t<b>Platform:</b> PlayStation 4\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n<p></p>\n\n  <p>Naughty Dog says that The Last of Us Part II is its biggest and most ambitious title to date. Recently, we got a small (two hour) taste of this ambitious project, but we walked away incredibly satisfied. It almost goes without saying that The Last of Us fans should be excited for the game’s launch on February 21, but here are four other big takeaways from our time with the game.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Prepare to feel rage</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The original Last of Us explored a child/parent relationship between Joel and Ellie. Naughty Dog says that if the first game was about exploring that kind of love, then the sequel explores a completely different kind of emotion: rage.</p>\n\n<p>Ellie grew up in a broken world – a planet where a fungal outbreak transformed most of humanity into zombie-like monsters. However, by the end of the first game, Ellie reaches a safe haven where it seems that she might have the chance to build a new life and experience some of the joys that many of us take for granted. As Part II opens, Ellie lives inside a relatively safe community of people and she even has the chance to explore a romantic relationship with another young girl named Dina.</p>\n\n<p>However, at some point in the game, Ellie faces a tragedy that completely changes her outlook. Naughty Dog remains tight-lipped about the nature of this tragedy, but the event sets Ellie off on a quest for revenge. In The Last of Us Part II, we’ll get to see how Ellie behaves after she’s had the safety of a “normal” life ripped from her – we’ll get to see the lengths with which Ellie will go to punish those who have hurt her. You can see the pain etched into the lines in Ellie’s face every time she sneaks up behind an enemy and slides her knife into their throat. The Last of Us Part II isn’t a game for the squeamish.</p>\n\n<h2>Movement is key to survival</h2>\n\n<p>Like the first The Last of Us, Naughty Dog’s action feels grounded and brutal. Enemies coordinate their attacks and even call to each other by name. Ellie’s luck can quickly run out of she is surrounded and outnumbered. One of the best strategies remains to stay hidden for as long as possible and pick off your foes one-by-one. Fortunately, environments are large enough that I found it easy to run and find a hiding spot to catch my breath. Still, enemies won’t forget that they saw you and are constantly on your heels, which adds a lot of tension to the action. I felt like I was constantly on the move – taking a few sections to loot a room or craft an item before I had to hide again from a roaming patrol.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike Joel, Ellie now has a jump button, so she can scamper and climb all over the environment. Climbing over things is sometimes a great way to avoid your captures, but it can also make you easier to spot.&nbsp;I found that it was often better to go low. Ellie can both crouch or go prone. Laying down in tall grass makes Ellie harder to spot, but as enemies get closer they will be more likely to see you. In The Last of Us Part II, you’re never completely hidden or safe.</p>\n\n<p><i>Click image thumbnails to view larger version</i></p><a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/c3db111c/tloupii_demo_screen_04.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/c3db111c/tloupii_demo_screen_04.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/dd972d47/tloupii_demo_screen_03.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/dd972d47/tloupii_demo_screen_03.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/e6c0973b/tloupii_demo_screen_02.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/e6c0973b/tloupii_demo_screen_02.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/b02834ef/tloupii_demo_screen_01.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/b02834ef/tloupii_demo_screen_01.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/a575f47e/tloupii_demo_screen_12.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/a575f47e/tloupii_demo_screen_12.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/f2852fd5/tloupii_demo_screen_11.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/f2852fd5/tloupii_demo_screen_11.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/dda011bd/tloupii_demo_screen_10.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/dda011bd/tloupii_demo_screen_10.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/ca57671e/tloupii_demo_screen_08.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/ca57671e/tloupii_demo_screen_08.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/65bfcc30/tloupii_demo_screen_07.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/65bfcc30/tloupii_demo_screen_07.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/a5573a7a/tloupii_demo_screen_06.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/a5573a7a/tloupii_demo_screen_06.jpg" /></a> <a target="_blank" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/25/e7604365/tloupii_demo_screen_05.jpg"><img align="left" height="100" border="3" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/s3/2019/09/25/e7604365/tloupii_demo_screen_05.jpg" /></a> <p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<h2>New enemies help heat up the action</h2>\n\n<p>The Last of Us Part II’s enemies are smarter than ever.

Getting new weapons can be a boon, but you’re subject to the luck of the draw. Hopefully an enemy drops an interesting component, because buying one in the in-game store is often prohibitively expensive. One interesting laser would have required me to replay a stage several dozen times to get enough gold. Nope! I did find a gauss gun that fired bouncing orbs – perfect for clearing out the myriad kill rooms that make up the bulk of the uninspired levels. That newfound sense of power didn’t salvage the plain fact that I was still using it in levels that were awkwardly structured, uninspired, and flat-out ugly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/24/dfcda200/contra2.jpg" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I appreciate the allure of so-called “so bad it’s good” gaming. This ain’t it, though. EDF has an unbelievably corny setup and amateurish production values, but it’s a perfectly functional shooter. Deadly Premonition is similarly cheesy, but it has heart and personality. Rogue Corps isn’t fun, interesting, or engaging. It’s an embarrassing mess that should be avoided. If you and your buddies want to just play something dumb to laugh at, there are many other, better options out there. Options that don’t require that you con them into picking up multiple copies of the game, too.</p>\n\n<p>You see, you can play local co-op in Rogue Corps, but you and your friends are cordoned off to a side mode. There, you can’t progress the campaign. Instead, they’re similar to the rifts in Diablo III, randomized strings of rooms and bosses designed to be replayed. Considering how grindy the game can be, it’s not a bad idea. The thing is, however, only the host gets to keep the accumulated loot and XP. Lame. I tried to play online, and there weren’t any lobbies that I could join. Considering that it launched today, that’s not exactly a great sign.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/24/35c44fe0/contra1.jpg" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I’ve spent about nine hours playing this game, and have no idea how many more stages are left until the end. I do know that levels are recycled only a few levels into the campaign, even to the point of putting the collectibles in identical locations. I don’t see a future in which the back half of Contra: Rogue Corps makes up for the abysmal first half. It would be irresponsible to assign a numerical score to something I didn’t complete, but all you need to know is that it’s irredeemably bad.

I did find a gauss gun that fired bouncing orbs – perfect for clearing out the myriad kill rooms that make up the bulk of the uninspired levels. That newfound sense of power didn’t salvage the plain fact that I was still using it in levels that were awkwardly structured, uninspired, and flat-out ugly.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/24/dfcda200/contra2.jpg" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I appreciate the allure of so-called “so bad it’s good” gaming. This ain’t it, though. EDF has an unbelievably corny setup and amateurish production values, but it’s a perfectly functional shooter. Deadly Premonition is similarly cheesy, but it has heart and personality. Rogue Corps isn’t fun, interesting, or engaging. It’s an embarrassing mess that should be avoided. If you and your buddies want to just play something dumb to laugh at, there are many other, better options out there. Options that don’t require that you con them into picking up multiple copies of the game, too.</p>\n\n<p>You see, you can play local co-op in Rogue Corps, but you and your friends are cordoned off to a side mode. There, you can’t progress the campaign. Instead, they’re similar to the rifts in Diablo III, randomized strings of rooms and bosses designed to be replayed. Considering how grindy the game can be, it’s not a bad idea. The thing is, however, only the host gets to keep the accumulated loot and XP. Lame. I tried to play online, and there weren’t any lobbies that I could join. Considering that it launched today, that’s not exactly a great sign.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<article class="embedded-entity">\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/prod-media.gameinformer.com/styles/body_default/s3/2019/09/24/35c44fe0/contra1.jpg" typeof="Image" class="image-style-body-default" />\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</article><p>I’ve spent about nine hours playing this game, and have no idea how many more stages are left until the end. I do know that levels are recycled only a few levels into the campaign, even to the point of putting the collectibles in identical locations. I don’t see a future in which the back half of Contra: Rogue Corps makes up for the abysmal first half. It would be irresponsible to assign a numerical score to something I didn’t complete, but all you need to know is that it’s irredeemably bad. Move along, folks.</p>'}, 'published': 'Tue, 24 Sep 2019 14:22:09 CDT', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=9, tm_mday=24, tm_hour=19, tm_min=22, tm_sec=9, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=267, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Jeff Cork'}], 'author': 'Jeff Cork', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Jeff Cork'}, 'id': '108655', 'guidislink': False}
