Part of that was down to its trailblazing predecessor and Sony's canny branding - classy, cool, and above all grown-up. Part of that was because it played the new DVD format relatively cheaply. But most of it was down to the console's astonishing software library, which matched quantity with quality all the way down. So many all-time greats made their debut on this machine, and so many creative, left-field gems too.</p><p>So it seemed like the only fair way to celebrate PS2's birthday was by running down 30 of our favourite games for it.

What were once basic polygon models overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds, interspersed with full motion video CG sequences has evolved - with full real-time rendering at a quality that far exceeds what Squaresoft could even dream of, let alone achieve back in 1997. The excitement is palpable - stoked still further by the surprise 'drop' of a demo early on Monday morning. </p><p>In an age of often colossal downloads, it's refreshing to see the demo clock in at just 8GB - a drop in the water next to the 100GB install size understood to be listed on the retail box. Still, the demo packs a real punch, offering 45-60 minutes of action, depending on how you tackle it, covering Cloud and Avalanche's route up to the first Mako reactor core. You learn the basics of combat, evade laser beam traps and end it all with a boss battle against a Scorpion boss. </p><p>It's literally the first hour of the game, but obviously, it's not final code - PSN hackers were able to access the demo months ago, after all. With that in mind, gameplay elements can be altered and story elements tweaked by the time the game launches on April 10th. Technically though, what we've got right here with this Unreal Engine 4-powered project is already extremely polished on PS4 and PS4 Pro, to the point where if Square-Enix ships the title like this, we'd be perfectly happy.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-final-fantasy-7-remake-tech-first-look"">Read more</a></p>"

Still, it took me a while to understand quite how I had to approach things, and it took even longer to let all my Mini Metro instincts fall silent.</p><p>Mini Metro is a game about making underground systems, creating various coloured lines that link together stations marked by a variety of shapes. The point, I think, is to encourage diversity. You want a line that can take any traveller to its intended station, which means a line that covers all the shapes for all the different shapes of traveller. It's wonderfully positive in this regard: it sees cities as places where diversity is a strength, and there's a certain understanding that if you're using public transport you're not going to go directly to your destination anyway - everyone is in it together, which means you can all expect to go around the houses.</p><p>Cars though! Mini Motorway initially looks kind of similar to Mini Metro. You have stores and you have houses, and you have to lay down roads to connect the stores to the houses. Basically, the stores make requests and people in the houses have to fulfil them, by sending cars out to the stores and then back to the houses. Rather than dividing things up by shapes, the game sorts by colour. Pink houses to pink stores! Orange houses to orange stores.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-03-mini-motorways-and-mini-metro-as-different-as-cars-and-trains"">Read more</a></p>"

The demo was available on Steam over the last few days, while the game itself is out sometime in Spring.</p><p>This is fairly well-travelled territory by now, but it doesn't stop Garden Story being wonderful. Your job is to restore a town to prosperity, harvesting stuff, clearing stuff up, knocking about gooey purple enemies known as the Rot. In the demo, you visit a new area that has fallen into ruin, do a few favours for a few people and then rattle through a mini-dungeon where simple combat combines with sokoban puzzles. Push those crates!</p><p>Combat and harvesting are all handled the same way: you have a weapon of some kind and you hit stuff. There's a stamina gauge to watch and enemies strike back every now and then, but the demo at least is very gentle. Alongside the stick I was hitting stuff with I also got a sickle by doing a solid for a lazy tomato, and there's a dowsing rod, which is essentially a fishing rod, that allows you to do damage too.

However, obviously, not every game is a stone-cold classic and in the process of building a retro gaming library, sometimes I end up picking up some less-than-impressive titles - which can still hold a certain fascination. So it is with Acclaim's Batman Forever, a 1995 title that builds upon developer <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-revisiting-mortal-kombat-the-legend-the-tech-the-ports"" target=""_blank"">Probe Software's Mortal Kombat codebase</a> to develop a co-op side-scrolling beat 'em up with some of the most baffling design decisions I've ever seen in a PC game.</p><p>In all honesty, it's possibly best to watch the embedded video below to see how this particular experience plays out because to begin with, Batman Forever seems to be a pretty typical example of the era. The neon-infused Val Kilmer incarnation of the Dark(ish) Knight patrols various side-scrolling levels, punching Final Fight-style individually named enemies until they're down. Optionally, the Chris O'Donnell-skinned Robin can join the fray for simultaneous two-player action, where the less dynamic duo seem to spend a lot of the time getting in each other's way. Everything plays out with the kind of digitised sprite work we saw in Mortal Kombat, which looked fairly impressive back in the day. We're hardly looking at cutting-edge fighting game mechanics, but we do get to enjoy a soundtrack from Tim and Geoff Follin and it doesn't <em>look</em> disastrous. Not to begin with anyway.</p><p>However, it's in the variation from the basic MK-style mechanics where things start to take a turn for the worst. It begins with the notion of a full-on moves list required for basic traversal and the fact that players need to refer to the manual simply to engage basic Bat-features. Simply using Batman's grapple gun to move between levels turns into quite the ordeal, unless you're blessed with a photographic memory. But even then, precise key strikes are the order of the day to get the job done - and don't think that using a gamepad makes the job that much easier. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-batman-forever-baffling-infuriating-bizarre"">Read more</a></p>"
28,In Theory: Can a four teraflop GPU cut it for a next-gen console?,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-in-theory-does-a-4tf-next-gen-console-make-sense,"<img src=""https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-02-28-20-50/digitalfoundry-2020-in-theory-does-a-4tf-next-gen-console-make-sense-1582923013639.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2080684.jpg"" alt=""""/><p>A next generation console with just 4 teraflops of GPU power? Well, that's the rumour. While Microsoft teases and tempts us with the 12TF behemoth that is Xbox Series X, rumours persist that a second box is in development, designed to hit the market at a much lower price-point, undercutting PlayStation 5 while still being able to play each and every next-gen Xbox game. Lockhart is its codename and I find the basic concept behind its creation absolutely fascinating.</p><p>While I suspect that there are important nuances in the design that have yet to be revealed, it's safe to assume that the basic premise is based on the theory that graphics are far more scalable than any other component of a particular game with the idea being that Series X targets 4K while Lockhart aims for 1440p instead. This is borne out by the various spec leaks we've seen, which paint a picture of a console that has far more commonalities with Series X than it has differences. Leaks suggest that Lockhart has the same eight-core/16-thread CPU cluster as the Series X (CPU clocks may be very slightly different) while it still uses an NVMe-based solid state storage solution. As it's designed to run at lower native resolutions than Series X, we should also expect a lower provision of GDDR6 memory too: 12GB vs the more capable machine's 16GB seems likely. </p><p>However, it's the pared back GPU that presents the biggest marketing challenge for Microsoft. In a world where Xbox One X hit the market with six teraflops back in 2017, how can a 4TF machine possibly cut it for next-gen? I suspect that this all about a combination of AMD's Navi architectural improvements which see a lot more 'performance for your teraflop', likely combined with more modern GPU features that the current console GCN architectures simply don't have. The architectural side of the equation is a matter of record already. Back in October last year, we put together an AMD build with 9.2 teraflops of Navi GPU power and found that we got over 80 per cent more performance from just 53 per cent more compute. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-in-theory-does-a-4tf-next-gen-console-make-sense"">Read more</a></p>"

I had that urge a ridiculous amount of times. To an extent, it was probably because I grew up with a Commodore 64 for a long time and those games were frequently delightful, yet also extremely limited compared to the options we have now. Throw in a lack of money and I was simply grateful for whatever came along, but that didn't stop me dreaming of how I wanted games to play out. </p><p>The dream was an RPG where you played a footballer working their way up to glory. I tried coding it in BASIC, mostly by writing it down in a notepad rather than actually sitting in front of the Commodore 64. Predictably, it was not a huge success, but I liked thinking it through. It was a similar case for many an adventure game, too. I think I realised at that young age that graphics weren't going to be my forte so I focused on storytelling and the text-based side of things. I just wanted to make <em>something</em>. Anything. </p><p>This was the opening for the Shoot-Em-Up Construction Kit. Sure, it wasn't about storytelling but it was about creating your own levels, creating enemy bullet patterns, changing the behaviour of enemies, and essentially setting yourself up for a spectacularly tricky bullet-hell experience. You could even export your games for others to play and yup, they did.

Long-time players threatened to boycott Blizzard games. Employees staged walkouts with umbrellas, a key symbol of resistance in the Hong Kong protest. United States senators, Ron Wyden and Marco Rubio, as well as representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mike Gallagher and Tom Malinowski, signed a letter to Blizzard, requesting the ban be fully reversed. And in Hong Kong, an anonymous group of game developers witnessed the far-reaching impact of his actions and was inspired to make a game about being at the frontline of the protests against the barrage of attacks by the riot police. The result was the protest game, Liberate Hong Kong.</p><p>""The initial idea [behind] this game is the incident of Blizzard. Blitzchung Ng just said eight words, [and] it created a large influence over the world,"" one member of the team, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal from the authorities, told Eurogamer.

There are disguises and mounted turrets and door scanners that you can bypass in various clever ways. It's all very tense and vivid.</p><p>But the enemy agent voices! Oh man. Baddies all have the classic espionage punctuation over their heads to tell you whether you've been spotted or not, but they also talk to each other. And the way they talk: it's just magical. It's every movie heavy in cinema reduced to grunts and muttering and the kind of noises you might make when you're moving a sofa.

It's not a very famous song, and although we had listened to it a lot together - along with many other classics from this magical moment in American pop - it didn't hold a particularly special meaning for us. The lyric is on point for a July wedding, sure, not to mention reminiscent of the heady days of late May and early June a couple of years earlier, when we had first dated as the heat started to rise off the London pavement and the city went happy-mad under an opening sky. But that's not why we picked it either.</p><p>We picked One Summer Night because it's doo-wop, and there is no more romantic sound on earth. If you want to make someone feel an almost painful nostalgic yearning; if you want to transport them to a world of elegant courtship and sublimated sexual heat; if you want their hearts to soar and break, and you want to do it all in under two-and-a-half minutes, then you can't do better than doo-wop.</p><p>Here's your potted wiki: doo-wop is a genre of rhythm and blues and a close cousin of rock'n'roll that was popular through the 50s and early 60s. It's defined by harmony singing, often contrasting a high tenor voice with a deep, deep bass, and was usually performed by penguin-suited vocal groups with names that instantly conjure a world of neon-lit diners and chrome-edged tailfins: The Drifters, The Skyliners, The Five Satins. Its roots go back to southern gospel but also to New York's pop production lines of the early 20th century, Tin Pan Alley and Broadway, and it has strong precedents in 30s and 40s vocal groups like The Ink Spots. Like hip-hop later, doo-wop was originated as an <em>a capella</em> street music by black teenagers who couldn't afford musical instruments, though it was quickly seized upon by Italian-Americans as well. The name doo-wop refers to the nonsense sounds often sung by the backing singers as a rhythmic bed for the lead's soaring melody.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-26-someone-should-make-a-game-about-doo-wop"">Read more</a></p>"

In <a href=""https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-specs-twice-as-powerful-as-xbox-one-/1100-6472198/"" target=""_blank"">a GameSpot story at the tail end of 2019</a>, Spencer invited us to 'do the math' based on the notion that the new console had twice the graphics power of Xbox One X and over 8x that of Xbox One. The implication was that the console packs a 12 teraflop GPU - but muddying the waters somewhat is the fact that innovations in GPU architecture meant that Microsoft wouldn't <em>need</em> 12TF to deliver 2x Xbox One X performance - our tests showed that a ballpark 9-10TF could conceivably get the job done.</p><p>The new blog clarifies the situation and it's only good news. With 12TF unambiguously confirmed, Microsoft may well have twice the basic level of GPU compute on tap, but actual gaming performance should exceed that handily. However, the firm goes further in explicitly stating that AMD's latest RDNA 2 architecture is at the heart of Series X, meaning that there may well be some further optimisations in the upcoming AMD Navi design implemented in the console that we are not yet aware of, simply because PC parts based on the latest architecture are not yet available for us to experiment with.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-xbox-series-x-power-play-analysis"">Read more</a></p>"

If you hop into a Stronghold, which is a sort of replayable mini-raid or ""strike"", by Destiny's terminology, you'll notice that in the occasional moments of downtime between fights, deep below ground, in the dank, dripping dungeon of giant spiders, the haunting echo of sleigh bells will just, ever so softly, start to fade in. A sort of wafting, aural threat, like they're about to summon a choir of the dead. Ominous!

So what's the secret? How do developers manage to achieve such impressive results from five-year-old Nvidia mobile hardware? </p><p>""At first, I did have really big concerns performance-wise,"" admits 4A's chief technical officer, Oles Shishkovstov. ""You know, going from base PS4/Xbox One with approximately six and a half or seven CPU cores running at 1.6 GHz to 1.75GHz down to only three cores at 1.0GHz sounds scary. The GPU was fine, as graphics can be scaled up and down much easier than, for example, game simulation code.""</p><p>The results of the conversion work are certainly impressive bearing in mind the yawning gap in CPU specs. 4A started out by translating over the existing Metro Redux games from PS4 and Xbox One (and to stress the point, Switch <em>doesn't</em> get last-gen ports here), a process the 4A team carried out very quickly, but this early version of the game could only manage frame-rates of around seven to 15 frames per second.

Cramming the entire adventure onto a cartridge was a real technical feat, the graphical nips and tucks were appropriate to the platform and the fact is played at all was something of a miracle. That said, there were still some key aspects missing we would have loved to have seen included in the port and what we <em>really</em> wanted to see was the ability to port saves between PC and Switch - a feature of <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-divinity-original-sin-2-a-perfect-mobile-complement-to-pc"" target=""_blank"">Divinity Original Sin 2</a> that played out beautifully on the Nintendo hybrid. The good news is that <a href=""https://thewitcher.com/en/news/31954/new-switcher-update-available-now"" target=""_blank"">patch 3.6 for Switch</a> adds this must-have feature - and a whole lot more.</p><p>In addition to the cross-save support, performance optimisations and additional graphics options are implemented, while touch controls make the cut - mainly for menu navigation. However, the big breakthrough is indeed the cross-save option and it works pretty much exactly as you'd imagine. You get a choice of Steam and GOG stores on the main menu and from there, you sign into your account of choice through the Switch browser, where you can select which saves to download. It's worth stressing you must own all DLCs and extras installed on PC for it to work properly but this is the only real catch. Otherwise it's seamless and operates exactly as it should.</p><p>Cross save support is a game-changer. What distinguishes the Switch version is the ability to take it anywhere - but obviously, this comes at a cost to performance and graphical quality. So why not play the game on the go on Switch, while enjoying a visually richer experience at home on PC? Patch 3.6 delivers this option - the best of both worlds.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-the-witcher-3-switch-patch-3-6-analysis"">Read more</a></p>"

Chris Hudak is riding the Caltrain to work, powerbook in his lap, dozing in and out of consciousness. Arriving into the office sometime around noon, he rocks up at his cubicle and is approached by team leader and head designer BJ West. BJ has decided, in his capacity as captain, that his motley crew really need a staff meeting. Furthermore, he determines it would greatly improve morale if that meeting were to be held at the Brass Rail, a nearby strip joint. In the words of Hudak, they ""all nod and gravely agree"".</p><p>Dave, the DJ at the Brass Rail, is no stranger to these 'meetings' and celebrates their entrance by playing a load of industrial metal, much to the dismay of the girl dancing on the stage. The team share a pitcher of beer and muse on how this beats the hell out of spending the day at Atari's offices. Everyone agrees and the meeting is concluded. Begrudgingly returning to work, the team cap off the working day with a plastic dart gun fight, conducted with weapons procured from the local Toys 'R' Us. Another typical day in the life of the Black ICE\White Noise team, a group of rookie designers charged with the near-impossible task of saving the Atari Jaguar from destroying America's most legendary video game developer.</p><p>The mid-90s were perhaps the most transformative period in video game history. The leap from 2D to 3D and the amount of experimentation that took place at the time still staggers me. It's not just the power of those once-new machines I find incredible, but the sheer amount of choice we had back then. Today, we have the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, two (relatively) similar systems, then there's Nintendo with its quirky little handheld, and the goliath that is the PC. But between 1993 and 1996, there were more failed major console releases than there were consoles released in the last decade. Nevermind the fact there were still multiple PC alternatives for the mouse and keyboard community, such as the Mac or the Amiga, or indeed Atari's own line of computers.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-19-the-story-of-black-ice-white-noise-the-atari-jaguar-saviour-that-never-came-out"">Read more</a></p>"

There's a lot to take in. </p><p>Thankfully Yakuza 7 is a lot of fun, and is a loving tribute to JRPGs and many other games besides. It all begins not with new hero Ichiban Kasuga, but with a glimpse into the life of Masumi Arakawa, head of the Arakawa Clan, itself a small family under the Tojo Clan. Arakawa hasn't had it easy - among other things his son was left disabled after Masumi had to hide him in a train station locker (!) as an infant. In typical Yakuza fashion, Arakawa saves teenage Ichiban's life, who then swears fealty to him and later goes to prison in his stead.</p><p>When Ichiban gets out of prison in 2019, 18 years after his incarceration, the world has changed rapidly, but the biggest shock is probably that the Arakawa family has joined the Omi Alliance, famously the nemesis of the Tojo Clan Arakawa originally served. When Ichiban tries to demand an explanation from Arakawa, his former saviour shoots him.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-17-yakuza-7-has-some-of-the-best-rpg-combat-in-a-long-time"">Read more</a></p>"

Combining traditional racing with bike-to-bike violence, Road Rash was one of EA's most exciting titles back in the early 90s, making a fantastic debug on Sega Mega Drive before making the transition onto what were then the next generation consoles. However, before the series hit the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, we got our first taste of how the series would evolve into an actual three-dimensional experience - in July 1994, Road Rash arrived on 3DO.</p><p>One of the first 'next-gen' consoles with 3D capabilities delivering games via optical disc, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer is something of a curiosity. Similar to the MSX of yore, the 3DO Company put together what you might call a reference design that was available for licensing, with manufacturing heavyweights such as Panasonic, LG (then known as Goldstar) and Sanyo each delivering their own take on the hardware across the system's relatively short lifespan. </p><p>Out of the box, the 3DO's best video output was a 480i interlaced video signal delivered via S-Video - which is something of a problem in terms of image quality as the internal framebuffer was actually a more traditional 320x240, or 240p. That's where <a href=""https://shop.dansprojects.com/3dorgb.html"" target=""_blank"">Black Dog Technology's 3DORGB mod</a> comes into play. Piggy-backing onto the GPU, the 3DORGB bypasses the system's internal interpolation and brings the best quality progressive scan output to the fore.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-retro-2020-road-rash-3do-black-dog-3do-rgb-mod"">Read more</a></p>"

FTL is, above all, a game about deciding what to do. Where to travel, when to buy, what to shoot - even where your little crewmember stands, if you're lucky enough to have one spare. You can drill down to the most micro of micromanagements or the broadest, most profound of overarching concepts in FTL and it will always, always come back to it. Choice, choice, choice. But where its choices really stand out - and where FTL itself stands out, even all these years after release - is when it asks you to make those choices blind. </p><p>Blind choices are, I find, often pretty awful. The big, clunkily jammed-in blind narrative choice with a side of disappointing consequence is all the rage amongst open-world blockbusters. More often than not it feels put there because core demographics respond well to the buzzwords, and more often than not it's the worst thing about the game it's in. Working your way through forty, fifty, eighty-odd hours of a game to find you got the bad ending by killing the wrong Named Enemy when you left the tutorial area - probably six months ago, by my rate of playing - is not, in my humblest of opinions, fun. You return from war, triumphant, to find your home town burned down because you said something mean to some guy (who was a douche and totally deserved it), and he went on a rampage while you were away. Or you can't, I don't know, play a good ten hours more of a game you're loving because you didn't feed the giant fish a peach three times and hop on one leg (this sounds like Sekiro but that gets a pass because it's ridiculous enough to be good, actually, so ignore that one). You get the point. I'm acutely aware it might just be me that struggles with blind choice and consequences, and I'm aware that entire studios (BioWare) built a reputation on them, but still. Not a fan.</p><p>But FTL! Of course FTL, the perfect video game, gets this right. For some reason I find blind choice in FTL the absolute opposite to blind choice everywhere else, refusing to look up the chances of success or the possible outcomes when, in just about every other game, I'd rather spoil the entire thing for the sake of getting the decisions right. I think part of it is just not being as invested in those stories - Assassin's Creed Odyssey is <em>wonderful</em>, for instance, but I play it for all the frolicking about on Mykonos and Spartan-punting people off ledges, not for the sporadic choice-based melodrama - whereas in FTL the consequence is the gameplay, and the gameplay is the story. You lose Dustin the Engi to giant alien spiders, and you're also losing your ship's best engineer and a level two weapons expert you've been training up for the entire run. You lose that guy and it <em>matters</em>, so you actually feel it, so you actually care about maintaining the surprise and the veil of ignorance around what decision most often leads to what. Inadvertently ruining Kassandra's story by stabbing some dude who it really seemed like you ought to stab is just a bit of a bummer.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-15-blind-choice-and-blind-luck-the-magic-of-ftls-superlative-decisions"">Read more</a></p>"

59,The Witcher 3 on Switch: what do you gain by modding and overclocking?,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-the-witcher-3-on-switch-modded-and-overclocked,"<img src=""https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-02-10-17-18/digitalfoundry-2020-the-witcher-3-on-switch-modded-and-overclocked-1581355117025.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2080007.jpg"" alt=""""/><p>We've looked at the process of <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-switch-overclocking-analysis"" target=""_blank"">overclocking the Nintendo Switch</a> in the past. We know that Nintendo chose to use Nvidia's Tegra X1 below its stock specification to preserve battery life and to more effectively manage thermals. But once you've overclocked a compromised unit, you can't help but wonder just how much extra performance you can unlock in any given game - and few titles challenge the Switch more than Saber Interactive and CD Projekt RED's port of The Witcher 3. Adding further spice is that a range of mods have emerged for the Switcher port, meaning that we can actually scale the game along with CPU and GPU clock speeds. </p><p>First of all though, let's be clear. Even without mods, <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-the-witcher-3-switch-tech-analysis"" target=""_blank"">The Witcher 3 is something of a miraculous conversion</a> bearing in mind the limited capabilities of the Switch. Coders of Nintendo's hybrid have become quite accomplished at scaling down graphics to the Maxwell-based mobile GPU but smart coding has seen the game somehow squeezed into running at a respectable frame-rate on just three available ARM Cortex A57 CPU cores running at a seemingly paltry 1.0GHz. If you own a Switch, we highly recommend this conversion as a handheld experience, though blown up large on your 4K TV, the blur factor in the visuals is just too much. But perhaps with some mods and an overclock, we can actually improve the docked experience? At the very least, perhaps we can get more of an idea of the kind of Witcher experience possible if Nintendo had stuck to Nvidia's stock CPU and GPU clocks - 1785MHz and 921Mhz respectively.</p><p>Before we go on, you should be aware of the dangers and challenges in overclocking Switch hardware. Only select models can be exploited, for starters, and once you start delving into areas of the Horizon OS and its software that you have no business meddling with, Nintendo is will within its rights to ban your console from access to its online services. Also worth mentioning is that overclocking obviously draws extra power and creates extra heat that the Switch may have trouble dissipating. I mean, we are talking about an extra 75 per cent of CPU power paired with a 20 point upclock on the graphics core.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-the-witcher-3-on-switch-modded-and-overclocked"">Read more</a></p>"

And it's a real nest-of-tables affair, stacked several levels deep. You wake up on a spaceship suspended, gorgeously, above the slowly turning surface of an alien planet. There's a voice in your head that seems to be telling you that there's someone else stuck on the ship too, and you should work to free them. And to do that? To do that you'll need help yourself.</p><p>This is where the filament comes into Filament. When you bobble around the ship and interact with a bit of broken technology, you get the chance to un-break it via a proxy. What this means is that every now and then you find yourself playing a neat little puzzle game in which a robot attached to an endlessly unspooling cord has to power-up a bunch of nodes by touching them all with the cord. It's deeply tangible stuff. Imagine you've got a table with a few nails sticking out of it, and you've got a piece of string tied to one of the nails. Can you loop the string around all the nails without crossing over yourself? That's Filament.</p><p>Of course, you need to get the cord around all the nodes and then still be able to make it to the exit that opens up once all the nodes are activated. All of this without crossing your own path! Filament's a wonderful puzzler, and it's also wonderfully maddening - because you can get the exit door open and then realise that you've trapped yourself in anyway.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-13-filament-is-a-puzzler-about-tying-knots-in-space"">Read more</a></p>"

Unfettered by the limitations of the current-gen consoles, CIG's efforts stand apart simply by virtue of the fact that it is not beholden to locked, ageing hardware designs - it's forward-looking in every regard and the way the technology scales and renders everything from a far-flung star system to the smallest piece of debris on a barren moon is an extraordinary technological achievement.</p><p>Of course, Star Citizen is a game that has attracted plenty of controversy in the way it is funded and related to that, how CIG has interacted with customers unhappy with its extended development. In 2012, the game raised $2.13m from its initial Kickstarter from 34,000 backers with a mooted 2014 release date. Recently, the studio revealed that investment stands at around the $250m mark with over 2.5m backers. The scope of the project has evolved alongside the size of its backing. An actual release date for what could be considered an actual game remains unknown but this clearly isn't vapourware - there is a real achievement here and on a recent visit to CIG in Wilmslow in the UK, I got to see something rather fundamental: how Star Citizen seamlessly scales from solar-level rendering to offering up the most minute detail on its richly rendered worlds. </p><p>One of the greatest challenges in getting Star Citizen working in the first place as a massively multiplayer game is due to the nature of its scale. In a typical game, you have dedicated levels or dedicated open worlds of limited size. Star Citizen operates on an entirely different level of magnitude - and to enable this, the developers converted the engine to use 64-bit coordinates to enable solar system-sized game spaces - 536,870,912 times larger than a space based on 32-bit float coordinates.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-star-citizen-tech-focus-alpha-3-point-8"">Read more</a></p>"

It was remarkable mostly for who I raced alongside, because the kart tracks back then were the proving grounds of what would become a golden age of British talent. There were the likes of Dan Wheldon, Jenson Button, Justin Wilson, Anthony Davidson and Mike Conway to name a few, though to say I went wheel to wheel with them might be overstating it a bit. I'm not sure any of them ever noticed me while I toiled at the tail-end. </p><p>There was one driver I got to properly race against, though, just as he was starting out. We were novice drivers, racing - as the rules dictated - at the back of the field, which would soon prove to be my natural habitat. Still, I came in to the race in Rye House's winter series off the back of a class win, so I was as confident as I'd ever been - confident enough to be taken aback at the young kid who outbraked me heading into The Esses in the dying moments of the final to take this particular class win. As a veteran of some three races I went to go and offer congratulations and some sage advice after the race. ""You'll do alright,"" I patronisingly said as I shook his hand and his dad packed their kart away in the background. </p><p>You've probably already guessed, but that kid was Lewis Hamilton, who went on to become one of F1's all-time greats. I liked Lewis back then - he was sweet and humble and from a more modest background than most drivers at the time - and while we've not met since that one encounter back at Rye House I like him even more now. His six world titles don't tell half the story, really, his achievements unsullied by the unsavoury tactics often employed by Senna and Schumacher, and all done in the face of persistent prejudice. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-09-going-up-against-a-legend-again-in-gran-turismo-sport"">Read more</a></p>"

One of the bad ones where your cuddly best mate wears an eyepatch and jackboots and everyone's suddenly got sinister facial hair. This would, in a way, be a comforting notion, except that it can easily be disproved with one simple look to the sky. If this really were a parallel world, even one of the bad ones, the sky would be filled with the silent, graceful shapes of airships gliding serenely back and forth. Nothing says 'parallel universe' like an airship. From Fringe to Doctor Who, from Wolfenstein to Bioshock Infinite, if you want people to know they're on the path not taken, bung a Zeppelin in the sky and, to be honest, you may not even need the evil goatees.</p><p>I've had a bit of a thing for airships since I was in my teens. I loved - and love - all airships, but it was the great steampunk contraptions of wood and cloth and wrought iron that had me most under their spell. Where the 'ship' is taken literally and a creaking old galleon is slung implausibly and enchantingly beneath bulging balloons. Games love them too - they're most associated with JRPGs, although I think it must have been in Super Mario Bros 3 that I first encountered them. But the airship that really sparked my love affair was in a much more obscure place. Does anyone remember the Fantastic Worlds expansion pack for Civilization 2? Anyone remember the airship units? I do. For some reason that unit captivated me. I loved it, in all its tiny, pixellated glory. I couldn't find a picture of it. Sorry. Take my word for it, though: that was a good airship. </p><p>The history of fantasy flying machines goes back further than you might think. Both the ancient Greek playwright Euripides and the historian Herodotus give the vengeful sorceress Medea a flying chariot drawn by dragons, which she uses to escape Athens after murdering her children.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-08-hot-air-and-high-winds-a-love-letter-to-the-fantasy-airship"">Read more</a></p>"

Clockwork God is different, however, because Dan has decided that indie games are the future and adventure games are history. So this means that while Ben is still playing an adventure game - collecting objects, combining them, solving puzzles - Dan is jumping around, leaping from ledge to ledge, and having indie platformer epiphanies all over the place.</p><p>Cue lots of jokes and set-pieces and a great deal of cleverness.

Stories last week suggested that the long awaited Switch Pro would arrive in 2020, with Nintendo bringing the fight to the next-gen Microsoft and Sony console launches. It all sounded rather unlikely and Nintendo was quick to dismiss the story. The current Switch range continues to sell relentlessly and there's no substantial commercial reason for Nintendo to release a more powerful model quite yet - nor to go head-to-head with PS5 and Series X with what would almost certainly be less capable hardware. However, the firm's partnership with Nvidia is likely to continue and three years on from the Switch's release, plans must surely be afoot for a next-gen system. On top of that, looking at <em>how</em> Nvidia's tech is evolving presents some mouthwatering opportunities for a new, more powerful Nintendo console hybrid.</p><p>Expectations should be tempered if the plan is to produce a more powerful console and nothing more. Fundamentally, compute power in a mobile device is limited by the need to accommodate a relatively small processor running at relatively minimal clock speeds. If we get anything close to the kind of performance we've enjoyed from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, we should consider that a minor miracle for a system derived from a processor designed primarily for mobile gaming. However, with that said, a new Switch based on more recent Nvidia technology opens the door to the firm's impressive AI upscaling techniques - and I decided to put them to the test in scenarios designed to more accurately represent Switch-level gaming.</p><p>I attacked this challenge on two fronts. First of all, AI upscaling technology is already available in a Tegra X1-based product - the newly revised Switch Android TV, a tubular revamp of the powerful streamer that Nvidia continues to support and upgrade. AI upscaling is exclusive to the new versions of the Shield, and works on any video content running on the machine - the only limitation being that anything above 30fps content is not supported.

I'd argue I'm living proof that's not the case: I'm abysmal at the things and I <em>love</em> them. Indeed, some of the games I love the most are from a genre with a reputation for being the most hardcore. Shmups, it would seem, are serious business. </p><p>Can you be a casual shmup player? Well I'm certainly one, drawn as much to the spectacle and strangeness of the genre. These things are so pure in their abstraction, and often so dazzling in their art and aesthetic, that I've always found them irresistible, even if I'm typically drawn to more stately classics such as Darius or Gradius which are more apt for aging players like myself. </p><p>Up until now I've never really dabbled so much in Cave's work, probably because I'd been put off by their own reputation: offering diamond-edged challenge and featuring arcane scoring systems, they've always seemed the preserve of the real purist. M2's Shot Trigger series seemed like a good point to jump in, though, especially now one of them's finally found its way to Nintendo's Switch (or at least it has in Japan, where it's still easily enough to grab a copy off the eShop if you can't be bothered with the hassle of importing). </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-02-03-unlocking-the-joy-of-one-of-gamings-most-hardcore-genres"">Read more</a></p>"

These are the titles that redefined the one-on-one beat 'em up and alongside SF2's cartoon stylings, Midway's digitised, violence-fuelled competitor captivated players with its memorable characters, surprisingly nuanced gameplay and buckets of blood. Highly innovative in many ways, it was put together relatively quickly by a development team of just four people. </p><p>Mortal Kombat started out as an experiment between friends John Tobias, Rich Divizio and Daniel Pesina. They filmed themselves performing martial arts moves with the idea of digitising them and putting into a game - an evolved approach to that taken by Atari with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit-Fighter"" target=""_blank"">Pit-fighter</a> two years earlier. Fellow Midway coder Ed Boon didn't think the initial pitch to Midway would work but did like the idea of a fighting game - suggesting that none other then Jean-Claude Van Damme should star in the title. Unfortunately, Van Damme declined the project forcing the team to rethink the concept and ironically, the actor would end up starring in the movie version of Street Fighter 2. </p><p>Work pressed ahead regardless, Boon joined the development effort, the digitisation technology was further refined and the game eventually shipped to arcades. It was a technologically advanced title for 1992, based on the Midway Y-Unit arcade board previously used in games including Smash TV and Total Carnage. Its impressive specs allowed the Y-Unit board to deliver large, high colour sprites and complex parallax background scrolling - high-end features that worked flawlessly in combination, outstripping the capabilities of the home consoles of the time.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-revisiting-mortal-kombat-the-legend-the-tech-the-ports"">Read more</a></p>"

I'm into a lot of planets, to be honest, because I just think planets are pretty interesting, but there's something about Neptune - above the big, beige, sickly '70s kitchen swirls of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, or the slightly threatening blankness of Uranus, or Mercury (boring), or Mars (old news, too many dead robots) - that makes Neptune stand out.</p><p>I think a lot of it is how it's pictured, which itself is obviously a lot to do with just how far away it is. We've only ever sent one spacecraft (Voyager 2, in the '80s) far enough out there into the abyss to actually capture images of Neptune up close. It's the only planet in our solar system so far away that it can't be seen without a telescope. The only one, as a result, the world's ancient civilizations never discovered - and doesn't it look the part? It feels like every image of Neptune is the same: deep, magnetic, hungering blue with the odd streak of white, stark against pure black. Massive, terrifying. I love it because it just seems so completely unknowable. If I think for too long about what it would be like to see Neptune in person I start to feel a little sick, like vertigo, or a sort of inverse claustrophobia. The same sense of cloying panic only from being so totally overexposed and far away, cut off and adrift, not just from Earth and home and people but from <em>everything</em>. From infinity! Eugh.</p><p>Anyway, I got to thinking about Neptune because I was, first, thinking about why some recent space-faring games - that I promise I want to love - have been so good at putting me off. Journey to the Savage Planet is the obvious one, but there's also The Outer Worlds which, to someone who has no desire to play any more of either, might as well be the same thing. The trend in these sorts of space games, it seems, is to use that setting's infinite opportunity for invention to make slightly wet, slightly clunky, slightly (but not entirely) self-aware London Underground poster jokes about capitalism and consumer culture - and to ignore all the actual space stuff.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-31-space-is-incredible-but-too-many-games-are-missing-the-point"">Read more</a></p>"

But I can't help but feel Blizzard has completely fluffed its release - and, worse of all, taken away what people already owned in a bid to funnel players towards this disappointing remake.</p><p>At its core Warcraft 3 Reforged offers pretty much the exact same experience as the 2002 RTS classic, save some balance changes, cutscene tweaks and mission re-jigging only the hardcore will notice. It's funny how even 18-year-old habits come back to you. Gryphon Riders are effective but squishy, so throw in a few Flying Machines to back them up, preferably with Flying Machine Bombs researched so they can attack ground units. Oh yeah! Night Elf Wisps don't cut down trees like the environmentally unfriendly humans and orcs do. Instead they sort of sap lumber from trees, and they don't need to traipse back to a Lumber Mill to drop lumber off, either. There's an initial thrill to playing Reforged, a joy in the rekindling of teenage memories. So much of Reforged is so similar to the original Warcraft 3 that it's easy to forget you're playing a remaster at all. Perhaps this is the biggest problem with the game.</p><p>Blizzard has upgraded Warcraft 3's visuals for Reforged. There are new and more detailed units. As you'd expect, the most work has been done for the hero characters, such as the doomed Prince Arthas and Horde leader Thrall. Reforged uses the faces of these new models as the new hero portraits (this was one of the first things I noticed was different, so seared into my memory are the original portraits). The ground, buildings and environments are more detailed, too. But this visual upgrade washes over you after a while. Warcraft 3 lets you zoom in for a closer look, but it's almost impossible to play the game effectively this way. Instead it's best to play with the camera zoomed out as far as possible, letting you take in as much of the battlefield as you can. But the farther away the camera, the less Warcraft 3's lick of paint matters. It doesn't take long before you forget Blizzard has upgraded the graphics at all.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-30-warcraft-3-reforged-houses-a-fantastic-rts-but-blizzard-has-fluffed-the-remake"">Read more</a></p>"

That's if you consider three games to be a good outcome. I love looking at the ground, so I'll take what I can get. Spintires, Death Stranding, and now Overpass: I'm happy.</p><p>All three games are sort of similar, it seems to me now. Spintires was bold enough to ask: what if driving games were all about getting stuck in the mud and maybe moving a couple of feet every hour? It turned out this was thrilling. Death Stranding asked: what if walking simulators really tried to simulate walking? What if the worst thing the post apocalypse could offer was a nasty tumble with a lot of boxes clamped to your back? And now Overpass asks: what if getting stuck in the mud and stuck on rocks was really exciting, and while you did all that stuff a counter was ticking along in the corner driving you into a frenzy?</p><p>Overpass tasks you with getting all terrain vehicles over terrible hurdles. There's mud! Such beautiful, churning mud. There's slippery rock and shifting sand. There are boggy patches and bracken, and there's also all manner of man-made stuff. Honestly, one of the worst things I have ever encountered in a game - and by worst I mean you get that strange thrill of dread that only games can conjure - is a series of concrete pipes half-buried in the earth. Or a bunch of logs laid lengthways and piled into wobbly ziggurats.

""Visual Futurist"" was his reply. Now there's a job role you'd enjoy explaining to people at parties. Mead was a modern-day farseer, using his skills as an industrial designer and concept artist to build the worlds of tomorrow. What's more, his visualisations have had an immeasurable impact on video games and the many artists working within the industry. </p><p>It's often said that games draw from an awfully narrow set of cultural and artistic touchstones. Never mind seven basic plots, there are only really two: sad man fights robots and space marines shoot aliens. Blade Runner, Aliens, Blade Runner again. Syd Mead, who died just a few weeks ago on the cusp of the new year, aged 86, is the artist behind the dominating aesthetic of an entire industry. His energy, spirit, DNA, spread out across games like ashes thrown to the wind.</p><p>In the 80s, Mead helped develop his fair share of theme parks and laser tag arenas, even a few casinos (pleasure hubs with as many flashing lights as any cyberpunk alley). It was always going to be natural for Mead to make the jump to games. He worked on a fair few: Cyber Speedway for the Sega Saturn was one of his earliest, making use of his famed vehicle-design skills. But he also returned to work on the lightcycles in Tron 2.0, designed the spaceships in Wing Commander 5, and even worked with Westwood Studios' on their Blade Runner game. Much of this work was early concepting, sketching out hover cars and so on. Other times it was consultation. Most recently, Mead consulted on Aliens: Colonial Marines, fleshing out what he'd started all those years ago on the James Cameron film. In some respects, we're unfortunate. An artist so talented, and willing to work in our space, who never found his 'big' game. But I don't think it matters - there are so many indebted to him, shot through with his style, infected with his imagery.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-29-from-aliens-to-cyberpunk-via-the-mass-effect-arc-syd-meads-artistic-legacy-lives-on-through-video-games"">Read more</a></p>"

It's <em>another</em> 80s-inspired coming-of-age tale that leans heavily on what's now a very well-worn brand of nostalgia - a mish-mash of Spielbergian sweetness, on-the-nose references and a synthwave soundtrack. So yeah, I was cynical, but good lord would you just look at this thing. </p><p>198X just drips with style, a style that's carried through from the cutscenes that tell the story of 'The Kid' through to the five pitch perfect pastiches of arcade classics that make up the bulk of play. I'm not entirely convinced by the story (maybe that's in part down to this being the first part of a planned series, so in the hour or so it takes to see 198X through it's only really just found its feet, or maybe it's a narrator who manages to sound both bored and melodramatic at once), but it's certainly well told - these are cinematics with a proper cinematic flair. There's plenty of Spielberg, of course, but also a dash of Ozu in glimpses of the everyday that feel like a welcome lift of the Japanese master's pillow shots. </p><p>Oh, and the games! They're the most assured part of the whole package, where the style you'll find elsewhere is matched by some deep understanding of the greats of yesteryear.

Originally released on the original PlayStation, it turns out that the same game was initially developed for the Super Famicon. More specifically, it was developed, completed, but never physically released and seemingly lost - until the combination of a freak discovery combined with the efforts of the game preservation community brought this title back from oblivion.</p><p>As we move into another awkward cross-gen development period, the recovery of Cooly Skunk demonstrates that while game makers have it tough today, the process was just as challenging in the move from 16-bit to 32-bit platforms. It's possible to compare the eventual PlayStation release with the Super Famicom original, and it's fascinating to see just how close the completed Nintendo original compared to the final PS1 release, while at the same time highlighting some radical differences.</p><p>But it's the process of Cooly Skunk's recovery that is borderline mind-blowing. The game was developed by a small Japanese company known as Ukiyotei. Founded in 1991 by Kenshi Naruse - previously of Capcom - Ukiyotei would develop a surprisingly solid stable of games during its 11-year run, including an adaptation of Hook for Super NES, published by Sony Imagesoft. Cooly Skunk began as a project to deliver a platforming mascot for publisher Bullet Proof Software, before being cancelled and rebooted for another publisher - Visit - who aimed to tailor game more towards US audiences. By the time it was completed, 16-bit sales were collapsing and so the decision was made to reboot the game for the PlayStation.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-cooly-skunk-the-cross-gen-console-game-recovered-from-oblivion"">Read more</a></p>"

In the distance, burnt debris circles a black hole's accretion disc: a graveyard of spaceship wrecks slowly being drawn toward their final deaths. It's an ominous sight - and a signpost to where you will also be drawn, pulled towards this place just as inevitably for the game's beautifully designed final moments - its Suicide Mission.</p><p>A decade on from Mass Effect 2's release, its finale stands up as some of BioWare's best ever work - and while the game's <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-15-mass-effects-best-mission"">follow-up certainly competed in its emotional stakes</a>, the Suicide Mission remains unparalleled in terms of its labyrinthine choice complexity. Not that much of this is visible to the player, of course. The best thing about the Suicide Mission is you can go into it blind, hoping you've done everything you can to protect your ship and crew - and still feel a gnawing doubt not everyone will make it out alive. But while this opaqueness makes for a nailbiting ride, it also hides some of BioWare's best decision-made gameplay, as choices here and from throughout your path through the rest of the game converge. It's why this mission fascinates me - long before I saw flowcharts being made to expose its inner workings. </p><p>Mass Effect 2 is a game about assembling your crew and earning their trust in readiness for this final mission. And what a crew - a rogues' gallery of aliens, former enemies and thinly-forged alliances, which makes for the trilogy's largest and most diverse cast. As the mission begins, it's a thrill to see this family you have spent dozens of hours with come together as the Normandy is plunged into danger - and as you realise any one of them can bite it. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-24-analysing-mass-effect-2s-audacious-final-mission"">Read more</a></p>"

You can visit Tuscany in Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed 2 sub-series, and roam a fantasy city inspired by Venice in Final Fantasy 15. You can fight in Venice in Final Fight 2 and in Pisa in Castlevania: Bloodlines. You can drive on Italian roads in Gran Turismo and you can ski on the Alps in Steep. You can murder in an imaginary Sicilian town in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin and in an imaginary town near Naples in Hitman (2016). But are these games ""Italian""?</p><p>
The answer is clearly ""no"". These games are developed by Japanese, American, European and international teams; Italy is just one of many geographical and historical flavours they add to their receipts. And the question could look quite uninteresting, too: why should you care whether a game is ""Italian""? Maybe you planned a trip to Italy and wish to eat pizza there, but you sense that at the end of the day Italy is not so important in the grander scheme of things. And I must admit you are right. But what's happening in Italy shows how developers are looking for their own identity, drawing new tools from their own cultural heritage and shedding light on lesser known stories and places.</p><p>
A 2016 survey claims that 11.4 per cent of tourists discovered the small Tuscanian town of Monteriggioni because of Assassin's Creed 2, which places the familial home of protagonist Ezio Auditore there. This case inspired local institutions interested in promoting smaller cities and developers interested in digging up new stories, traditions and legends for their video games. ""They always say that video games are a global medium that should be designed with a wide, international public in mind,"" sats Andrea Dresseno, the founder of <a href=""https://ivipro.it/en/home-en/"" target=""_blank"">IVIPRO</a>, the Italian Videogame Program. ""That's very true. This, however, doesn't preclude the possibility to use this medium with the aim to reach a specific public that was never reached before, or as a means to talk about particular themes in a local setting."" IVIPRO is an Italian association that seeks to connect institutions and developers in order to promote video games set in Italy. ""First and foremost, it is necessary to start distinguishing between the different types of works and the various aims [they chase]"" Dresseno continues. ""I always hear people talking about business, about the importance of the growth of this industry, about investments and revenues. All of that is legitimate, but are we sure that the only way to use and take advantage of video games as a medium is to profit from them? Let's try to look at video games as a medium of communication and expression, not only as a product. By shifting the perspective, we could start using [video games'] peculiarities in a way that's free from the constraints (and the stereotypes) imposed by the commercial urgency.""</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-25-giving-video-games-a-distinct-italian-flavour-doesnt-mean-what-you-might-think"">Read more</a></p>"

We spend a lot of time as players thrilling over compositions and effects that get the adrenaline flowing - spectral piano, frantic violins, ambient mitherings that might, if you're very lucky, just be a broken aircon - but what about the compositions and effects that soothe and reassure? The Resident Evil series is full of them: bundle together every last Save Room melody and you've got a half-decent yoga playlist, though I'd probably chuck in some Okami or whatever to lift the mood. Gears of War has that satisfied guitar purr when you've winkled out every last Locust. The Sunless games have their port themes, wafted to you from off-screen like smoke on the breeze - music indeed to the captain coasting home on their last few lumps of coal. </p><p>And what of Song of Horror, Protocol's absorbing homage to the Silent Hills and Alone in the Darks of yesteryear? In Song of Horror, safety is a soft tap, right on the edge of hearing, like somebody very carefully setting down a glass. All being well, you'll hear it after a few seconds when you put your ear to a door. The tap, which surely represents a lot of calculation on the part of the audio designer, is a vital cue in a game where silence has many textures. Sometimes, silence sounds like silence. And sometimes, it sounds... bonier. Squelchier. As though you had your ear pressed against a misbehaving stomach. In which case, opening that door is... unwise. Better to switch to your map screen, work out another route, and hope like hell that when next you put your ear to a door, the tap is all you can hear.</p><p>Now three of five episodes in, Song of Horror is a third-person, combat-free spookfest with automatic camera perspectives and a refreshing taste for the procedural. Players rove dark, abandoned buildings solving puzzles while evading various ambient threats known collectively as the Presence. Snooping at doors is crucial because said threats - which kill off characters forever, should you fail the associated QTEs - are ever-changing, assuming different forms at different times in different places, based on a mixture of loose scripting and monitoring of player behaviour. You're hurrying down some stairs, brandishing a candlestick like the shotgun you sorely wish you had, when oily black handprints blossom all over the walls. You're inspecting a desk when something bandaged and breathy pops up on the other side of it, snuffling for your blood.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-16-song-of-horror-is-a-quietly-inventive-homage-to-survival-horrors-glory-days"">Read more</a></p>"

In games and films the answer is often surprising. There is a wonderful moment in Inception in which Ariadne - <em>Jesus</em>, Nolan - takes a Parisian boulevard and folds it over on itself. It's one of those instances of sheer cinematic glory: the horizon rises up and bends back, until buildings rest overhead and the sky is dark with tarmac and cobbles. </p><p>Beyond the effects, what sells this moment? The reactions, certainly: DiCaprio as ever gets a lot into the business of doing very little. But there's also a sound effect that for me elevates the whole thing. What should it sound like for a city to fold over on itself? In Inception it sounds both sparse and industrial: the core of the thing is the sound of an iron support pinging and creaking under growing strain. Paris is made of limestone, isn't it? But in Inception, for this instance, it's really made of iron: the framework bends and flexes but will ultimately hold. Paris, like Irn Bru, is made of girders.</p><p>Inception is a movie with architectural preoccupations, so perhaps this flair for buried structure should be expected. Monument Valley, which I've been playing on and off for the last few weeks, also has architectural preoccupations. So what is <em>this</em> world made of? Taut strings plucked and clockwork turning: you move the landscape around and you hear evidence of escapements and other watch parts, dainty old music boxes and tightly rigged automata. All of this conjured through sound. All of this the kind of stuff that children ought not be allowed to play with for fear of damaging.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-19-to-play-monument-valley-is-to-marvel-at-how-it-works"">Read more</a></p>"

Walk through any major city and you'll find rough sleepers asking for change, tents pitched under overpasses, and charities trying to provide aid. Despite all these signs, and the rise in homelessness over the last decade, this tragedy is often ignored and overlooked on both a government and individual level, culminating in businesses even incorporating anti-homeless architecture into their designs, and laws that force rough sleepers out of certain areas.</p><p>A lot of games feature homelessness too, but these NPCs often suffer the same sympathetic dismissal as those on the streets. Several games trying to underpin the unpleasantness, hopelessness, or ruthlessness of their world sprinkle homelessness throughout their cities. But without any meaningful consideration, they are rarely any more than set decoration.</p><p>In 2016, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided let players explore a dystopian Prague filled with homeless beggars, there to emphasise the state of the world and its view of Augs. Like other NPCs wandering around Prague, some dispense tiny bits of dialogue if you try and interact with them, but others exist only to highlight the political climate. Players can't offer them change or even reply to them, they are nothing but a feature of the landscape, like the inanimate billboards that also tell the city's darker story. All the way back in 2010, the first game in the Metro series had homeless metro dwellers living alongside the apparently non-homeless residents of the metro. Although everyone was displaced by the nuclear holocaust above, there are still the haves and the have-nots in this world, with some seemingly extra homeless compared to others. At least these games allow you to give them a bullet or two.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-18-how-life-is-strange-2-challenged-video-game-representations-of-homelessness"">Read more</a></p>"

100,How the new Doom patch dramatically improves previously flawed ports,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-bethesdas-flawed-doom-ports-are-now-excellent,"<img src=""https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-01-16-11-06/digitalfoundry-2020-bethesdas-flawed-doom-ports-are-now-excellent-1579172779784.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2076403.jpg"" alt=""""/><p>What should have been a beautiful piece of retro fan service didn't quite work out. Last year, fresh ports of the original Doom trilogy arrived across a range of devices and while Panic Button's Doom 3 port hit the target, Nerve's conversions of the original Doom and its sequel left a lot to be desired. Incorrect lighting, broken music, stretched aspect ratios and other issues impacted what should have been a joyous celebration of a genuine gaming phenomenon. However, it's all changed now: while not quite perfect, I can highly recommend these revised ports and in fact, this is one of the most significant game patches I've looked at during my time at Digital Foundry.</p><p>To begin, it's worth pointing out that while the new update contains a wealth of new additions and fixes, not every feature is brand new - the game's first patch already managed to correct a selection of the more egregious issues. The incorrect lighting levels in the original release were fixed months ago in the 1.03 update, the mandatory Bethesda.net login requirement was removed and the speed and quality of the audio was also improved. Patch 1.03 basically delivered the game we should have experienced at launch and to be fair, Bethesda could have left things along at the point. However, the decision was taken to further refine it - and this is where things get interesting.</p><p>A crucial addition is support for additional WAD content packs. In its current state, both Doom and Doom 2 receive the WADs created for Final Doom while the original Doom also receives John Romero's Sigil with Doom 2 benefitting from Nerve's own No Rest for the Living. This is a huge bonus feature as these additional WADs are all of very high quality, bringing a lot of extra content to the game for no additional cost. According to the patch notes, the team is also curating additional WADs which will become available in due course. While the PC original has no restrictions on what WADs you can run, it's great to see extra content arriving for the console platforms.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-bethesdas-flawed-doom-ports-are-now-excellent"">Read more</a></p>"
101,Games were nowhere and everywhere in an exhibition about the war against rest,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-16-games-were-nowhere-and-everywhere-in-an-exhibition-about-the-war-against-rest,"<img src=""https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-01-15-17-12/games-were-nowhere-and-everywhere-in-an-exhibition-about-the-war-against-rest-1579108334896.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2076307.jpg"" alt=""""/><p>Over the Christmas break I gave up Pokémon Go. It wasn't on purpose - in fact I think I actually stopped playing a little earlier than that, missing a community day for some weekend commitment or other and then all of a sudden falling off the wagon entirely. But even if it was an accidental cold turkey, quitting has given me a strange sense of pride. I love Pokémon, and I think Pokémon Go is, for the most part, pretty great. It gets you out and about, it's wonderfully social, it's a complete change of pace from regular mobile gaming and, obviously, it is still Pokémon. But all the same I am mighty glad to see the back of it, because for all its pleasures Pokémon Go's grip on my attention and time has, quite frankly, felt rather tyrannical.</p><p>To really keep the pace in Pokémon Go you must log in and complete not one, not two, but three different tasks, daily, as a minimum. On top of the regular loop there are then rotating legendaries and rotating research rewards, changing each month or so. There are rotating raids and raid days and raid hours. There are special bonus weeks and weekends; special quests and special cosmetics; special, entirely functionless versions of Pokémon you already have that are wearing special hats. In one sense it's brilliant: an extraordinarily continuous flow of things to see and do in a game that, as a collectathon, has a finite limit on the number of creatures to catch. At the same time, for anyone caught in the loop but unwilling or unable to fully, wholly commit to it as their sole game - or more than that, their sole hobby - it can be an absolute disaster.</p><p>The result of that disaster is people like me: lovers of Pokémon, who grew up with it and failed to fully grow out of it, now with a bit of disposable income and an hour a day of uncolonised time spent walking to and from work making them the primest of marks - but who are instead thoroughly burnt out. It's a strange, oddly alienating feeling. Pokémon Go is far from the only game to do this - it's not even the only game to do it to me personally, as a football fan and player recently freed from the compulsions of FIFA Ultimate Team - but it does feel like a fairly recent phenomenon.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-16-games-were-nowhere-and-everywhere-in-an-exhibition-about-the-war-against-rest"">Read more</a></p>"

However, PC owners today have the ability to preview all of these technologies running in tandem in one of the most impressive and performant game engines around. Yes, Wolfenstein Youngblood has been patched to support the gamut of Nvidia RTX features and the results are highly impressive. </p><p>So what do users of RTX cards get with this new update to the latest and possibly last id Tech 6 title? Taking centre stage is ray tracing support, where the developers target one of the most challenging and expensive RT techniques: reflections. Much like Control or Battlefield 5, ray tracing replaces the game's use of cube maps and screen-space reflections on nearly every surface. In addition to increased realism, you also get the ability to 'see' reflections of the in-game world that don't exist in screen-space - like the player characters themselves, for example. However, the implementation is much wider ranging than you might imagine. </p><p>The embedded video on this page illustrates a couple of key aspects. First of all, you get to see how standard cube maps and screen-space reflections actually work - and then you get to see the more accurate ray traced alternative. It's quite fascinating how as players we've become accustomed to what are fundamentally compromised results. Game makers have got really good at 'faking' these effects and I also suspect that as virtually every major engine uses similar techniques, we've grown accustomed to their lack of realism. So when you sit down and study how those reflections should actually look, the results are eye-opening.Youngblood's effect is realistic right down to the most incidental details in the tiniest reflections.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-wolfenstein-youngblood-rtx-upgrade-analysis"">Read more</a></p>"

Some might say that the most impactful console launches were those where cutting edge hardware was matched with gaming experiences we'd never seen before - titles that set the stage and the expectation level for the generation to come. Even if a specific next-gen platform exclusive wasn't an all-time great, experiences that pushed the technological state of the art still held a special place in our hearts - games like Ryse: Son of Rome or Killzone Shadowfall, for example. However, Microsoft is charting a different course with its Xbox Series X strategy. Yes, there will be first-party exclusives but these titles will still run on existing Xbox One hardware. Nobody will be left behind in the inevitable cross-gen period - but does this mean that the pioneering next-gen spirit is gone?</p><p>The current discussion stems from <a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-11-dont-expect-first-party-xbox-series-x-exclusives-for-a-couple-of-years"" target=""_blank"">comments made by Xbox Game Studios boss Matt Booty</a> in an <a href=""https://www.mcvuk.com/we-need-to-deliver-on-the-promises-that-we-make-xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-on-the-future-of-xbox/"" target=""_blank"">interview with MCV</a>. ""As our content comes out over the next year, two years, all of our games, sort of like PC, will play up and down that family of devices,"" Booty said. ""We want to make sure that if someone invests in Xbox between now and [Series X] that they feel that they made a good investment and that we're committed to them with content.""</p><p>In short, Microsoft will continue its strategy of delivering first-party studio titles to both Xbox and PC - but for the next year or two, legacy consoles will be supported too. Before the interview, we knew that this would be the case for some titles - after all, Halo Infinite was specifically acknowledged as coming to Xbox One. However, the situation was less clear with other titles. An in-engine Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 trailer, for example, was recently released and according to Phil Spencer, ""the game is being built to leverage the full power of Xbox Series X. The footage shared tonight was captured in-engine and reflects the power of Xbox Series X available to developers to deliver new universes, experiences and games in ways you have never imagined.""</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-can-microsoft-deliver-next-gen-experiences-while-still-supporting-xbox-one"">Read more</a></p>"

Luria's someone whose work I've circled for a while without ever having the nerve to head in. Now I realise I must, because Sacks quotes just one line of Luria's, and I am besotted.</p><p>Luria's talking about the body. ""The thing is,"" says Sacks, ""he would grasp the character or nature of various things as a <em>whole.</em>. A sentence of his that has truly resonated for me was, 'The body is a unity of action' - since for others it's just 'a mass of tissues' - 'and that which is cut off from the unity of action is <em>unbodied.</em>'"" Sacks loves that line, and so do I. I've been thinking of it ever since. At first it seems like poetry - the body is a unity of action! - but the more I turn it over, the more it seems precise. He is drawing a line around the body. He is grasping the totality of it in a way that seems very useful.</p><p>Please believe me, at the same time as I was on the train the other day reading this, I was dipping in and out of recent Eurogamer podcasts, and there's one podcast in particular that sort of lined up beautifully with Luria.

Next-gen before their time? There's an elite selection of technologically advanced titles that appear towards the tail-end of any given generation, where developers are upping their game, experimenting with the kinds of techniques we'll see in the era to come - and it's typically on PC where we tend to get these nascent next-gen experiences. CD Projekt RED's The Witcher 2 - released in May 2011 - is one such release, a game that required a radical process of re-architecting before arriving on Xbox 360 almost a year later. But what made The Witcher 2 so special, how did it push PC hardware and can even today's mainstream graphics tech handle the game's legendary ubersampling?</p><p>Of course, the profile of The Witcher 2 is especially heightened at the moment with the recent series release on Netflix generating unprecedented interest in Geralt of Rivia's escapades - but it's not just the story and the world presented in these games that has driven their popularity. Starting with The Witcher 2, we've seen CD Projekt RED deliver some hugely ambitious, game-changing technology. The fact that the studio targeted PC - a format 'apparently' in decline back in 2011 - was remarkable in itself but without explicitly targeting mature (ie old) console hardware, CDPR pushed its game to the next level. Alongside titles like Far Cry 3, Battlefield 3 and Crysis 3, the PC showcased visuals much closer to those we would see in the now current generation of console hardware and it did so two-and-a-half years before they would arrive. </p><p>The Witcher 2's next-gen credentials are first established when it comes to characters and environments. In 2011, CDPR's new showcase pushed geometry count beyond the capabilities of the consoles meaning that edges on models were much smoother than the average AAA game, and the amount of detail on models (represented by real geometry instead of just textures) was much higher than typical high budget releases. Take the opening scenes of the game in the Timerian Dungeon - if you look across many of the surfaces and individual assets, you see almost unprecedented levels of detail. Outdoor scenes thick with undergrowth and dappled lighting look even more beautiful.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-the-witcher-2-2020-vision-retrospective"">Read more</a></p>"

Beyond surface xeno-weirdness, it's what clever animation and the <a href=""https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-octopus-arms-make-decisions-without-input-from-the-brain"" target=""_blank"">neural marvel</a> have in common that has me interested. Since an octopus arm is infinitely flexible, it faces a unique challenge. How do you move an arm to set x,y,z coordinates and a certain orientation if it has infinite degrees of freedom in which to do it? How might the octopus arm tackle its virtual cousin's task of going to grab the player when they could be anywhere in the room - free even to move as the animation is first playing?  </p><p>You simplify. The former Dead Space developer and current senior core engineer at Sledgehammer Games, Michael Davies, took me through the likely digital solution. The drag tentacle is rigged with an animation skeleton - bones to twist and contort it so animation/code can bend it into different shapes. A trigger box is placed across the full width of the level Isaac needs to be grabbed from, with a pre-canned animation designed specifically to animate to the centre of it. Finally, to line up the animation to the player, inverse kinematic calculations are done on the last handful of tentacle bones to attach the tentacle pincer bone to the ankle bone of Isaac, while also blending the animation to look natural. </p><p>The octopus, conversely, constricts any of its flexible arms' infinite degrees of freedom to three. Two degrees (x and y) in the direction of the arm and one degree (the speed) in the predictable unravelling of the arm. Unbelievably, to simplify fetching, the octopus turns an infinite limb into a human-like virtual joint by propagating neural activity concurrently from its 'wrist' (at the object) and central brain and forming an 'elbow' where they meet -  i.e. exactly where it needs to be for the action. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-09-like-animals-video-game-ai-is-stupidly-intelligent"">Read more</a></p>"

Fourteen year old Lottie instantly became immersed in a society where the line between reality and cyberspace was slowly fading away, where megacorporations have replaced governments and it's impossible to tell exactly how human anyone is. (She also had a bit of a crush on razorgirl Molly Millions.) </p><p>My love for cyberpunk as a genre is why I'm both excited and a little bit nervous for Cyberpunk 2077. From what we've seen from the current Cyberpunk 2077 trailers, the game's depiction of the genre is based on the tropes that were established during its founding years. Night City is divided into the people favoured by the ruling corporations and those they'd rather forget. V, the protagonist, is a cybernetically enhanced mercenary, who gains the ability to stream the emotions of another person into their brain. It does sound like the synopsis for a 1985 cyberpunk novel, which I'm looking forward to playing, but, at the same time, I would also like to see Cyberpunk 2077 develop the genre. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-09-2020-in-preview-cyberpunk-2077-could-bring-a-reemergence-of-the-cyberpunk-genre"">Read more</a></p>"

Day after day we'd all bring in a 3DS and compare our latest market prices. And when one person's town was paying out more than 100 Bells per vegetable? We'd all gather round, pile in, and sell sell sell.</p><p>If this all means absolutely nothing to you then, rest assured, you are definitely the well-balanced one in this paragraph. But this communal experience we'd all buy into - literally, I suppose, playing the game's stalk market - became a shared demonstration of Animal Crossing's magic. Invest any time into a town and it becomes impossible not to get drawn in by its wholesome fictions, where your mundane tasks become part of something far more valuable. </p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-09-2020-in-preview-animal-crossing-new-horizons-and-the-pleasures-of-a-gentle-life-sim"">Read more</a></p>"
116,Modern Warfare 2019's classic Call of Duty 4 maps compared to the 2007 originals,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-modern-warfare-legacy-map-head-to-head,"<img src=""https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-01-08-16-50/digitalfoundry-2020-modern-warfare-legacy-map-head-to-head-1578502207646.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2075275.jpg"" alt=""""/><p>Infinity Ward redefined the console shooter with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but just how much has the core game technology evolved since it launched way back in 2007? While it's safe to say that the scale and scope of both the campaign and multiplayer experience have increased enormously across the current console generation, Infinity Ward recently updated Modern Warfare 2019 with remakes of legacy COD4 maps - Crash, Vacant and Shipment. Comparing the new versions against the 2007 originals - and indeed the Modern Warfare Remastered equivalents - shows up some fascinating results. </p><p>So, how do they stack up? Well, the layouts are clearly based on the same blueprint though the reboot's use of more accurate physically-based materials and lighting mark a big change. Credit where it's due; the original designs still look authentic and rich with detail. Given its release date, it's surprising how well it hold ups, even without today's advances in lighting and post effects. It truly speaks to the way Infinity Ward gunned for materials that blended effectively into the scene in 2007: the properties of each concrete slab, brick and wood support were baked in, but they were nonetheless convincing for the day - especially at the low output resolution on last-gen machines. </p><p>The reimagining of the Crash map is an especial highlight for me, showing many of the key improvements delivered in the revamped COD engine. The new version is layered with a swathe of small points of interest, from the dramatic new opening helicopter descent to the addition of shop signs across a market street. Obviously, the original map was built for less powerful hardware and, as such, perhaps not everything that appeared on the concept sheet would have made it to the final map. What we have in the rebooted Modern Warfare though, gives us a radical upheaval in so many ways: textures are of a higher resolution, motion blur is added, while light shafts flicker through gaps in windows. Geometric detail is also drastically overhauled: debris, plant life, housing supports - everything is remodelled.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-modern-warfare-legacy-map-head-to-head"">Read more</a></p>"
117,Microsoft's Xbox Series X silicon reveal: is this the biggest console processor ever made?,https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-microsoft-xbox-series-x-silicon-reveal-analysis,"<img src=""https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-01-08-14-25/digitalfoundry-2020-microsoft-xbox-series-x-silicon-reveal-analysis-1578493548559.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/2075235.jpg"" alt=""""/><p>Microsoft's gradual ramp-up to the full reveal of the Xbox Series X continues with Xbox chief Phil Spencer sharing the latest clue towards the technical makeup of the new console. On the face of it, updating a <a href=""https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1214249442682916864"" target=""_blank"">Twitter profile picture</a> with a low quality shot of Project Scarlett silicon might not sound like a big deal - but when Microsoft's stated aim is to deliver the most powerful console of the next generation, commentators (including us!) will grab every opportunity we can to learn more about the new machine. And the evidence does suggest that we're looking at the largest console processor released by Sony or Microsoft to date, further solidifying expectations of extreme performance.</p><p>Actually getting any kind of meaningful measurement from this latest controlled leak from Microsoft isn't easy. Perhaps purposefully so, the image is of a low resolution, taken at an angle and with a curious lens distortion effect. The measurement of silicon area is important though - we can safely assume that the Scarlett processor is fabricated with the same 7nm lithography as AMD's latest Zen 2 and Navi chips - the core building blocks at the heart of this year's wave of new consoles. Stacked up against AMD parts using the same production techniques, we can get some idea of the scale of its graphics core.</p><p>Ascertaining the size of Microsoft's chip gives us some idea of its architectural makeup - but more than that, area on a microprocessor isn't cheap. Every square millimetre adds to build cost and it has to count. Yes, comparisons against new AMD parts could be valuable, but comparing chip measurements with prior console generations also gives us some idea on just how much investment Microsoft is sinking into this new console - and by extension, how much it'll cost to build and how much we may end up paying for it.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-microsoft-xbox-series-x-silicon-reveal-analysis"">Read more</a></p>"

</p><p>For me, every Halo game has been chasing one moment - or rather, one sequence, because it's probably stretching the boundaries of the word 'moment' to call it that. Anyway, you've come out of deep freeze and left the Pillar of Autumn. You've landed on some weird alien artefact shaped like a ring. And then - </p><p>Peace! Peace and space! An artefact that looks nothing like technology, an artefact that is a single redwood forest world - mountains, trees, lakes - rising up into the sky. And it's all yours to explore.

Let other games chase the easy pitch; instead, here's a 19th century story of brothers protecting a homestead from wolves and other beasties, a game about managing diminishing resources by placing traps and gadding around a map in real-time as you give your foes a wintry shoeing.</p><p><a href=""https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-01-08-2020-in-preview-wicca-is-a-game-with-an-awful-lot-of-ideas"">Read more</a></p>"
